# KAMADHENU — Phase 0 audit (repository and environment)

Written 6 Sep 2026, 5:20 pm IST, from the files as they are in this repository (`Tribhuvanachar/bhumandala`, branch
`main`). Nothing was modified for this audit. Numbers come from `kamadhenu/data/audio_inventory_stats.json`, which
`kamadhenu/scripts/build_audio_inventory.py` recomputes from the measurements in `kamadhenu_dataset/`.

**Where things live.** Kamadhenu is a sub-project of the DGE repository. Its working files are under `kamadhenu/`
(this audit, the status file, `data/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`). The raw measurements, manifests and the audio drop-zone
made by the earlier master audit stay in `kamadhenu_dataset/` (audio itself is git-ignored). The deployment scaffold
is `tools/kamadhenu/space/`, the analysis toolkit `tools/kamadhenu/`, and the reader-side client `dge/js/kamadhenu.js`.

Git history for the Kamadhenu files: master audit 5 Sep 2026; Viṣṇu Sahasranāma + 'vsn' mapping, Chandas engine
gap-closure, ZeroGPU deployment reference, Space scaffold and the HF account on 6 Sep 2026.

## 2. What is reusable as-is

* The DGE Chandas engine as the authoritative analysis layer (syllables, laghu/guru, gaṇa, pāda split, metre, yati).
  It already covers 245 vṛttas; nothing needs to be hard-coded.
* `tools/kamadhenu_audit.py` as the data-preparation driver: it is idempotent and re-analyses only new files.
* The measured `audio_inventory.json` (no re-decoding needed) and `metadata.jsonl` (already one record per
  audio file with text, normalised text, metre, laghu/guru, pāda count, yati, quality grade, mapping confidence).
* The Vāgdhenu serving pattern (ZeroGPU Space) and its Sanskrit frontend ideas (pronunciation transforms), under
  Apache-2.0, credited in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` of the Space bundle.

## 3. What is incomplete

* Speaker identity: decided 6 Sep 2026 — the Drive recordings and the Narasiṃha files are **3BHU1** (the project lead, consent given, `kamadhenu_dataset/speakers.json`); Sumadhva Vijaya / Rāghavendra Vijaya confirmed as 3BHU1 at 6:35 pm — every recording is his.
* Human verification: 0 reference recordings listened to; the review queue (405 Gītā files, 106 'vsn' files) is
  unanswered.
* 989 Sumadhva Vijaya files are 11 kHz / 16 kbps MP3 and 46 files are byte-identical pairs (wrong verse served).
* 486 Rāghavendra Vijaya files are grade D (clipped / noisy).
* The pilot dataset, validation script, model selection, training pipeline, evaluation, experiments: not started.

## 4. What is missing

* Any recording of 219 of the 256 metres in the database; only 16 metres have good coverage.
* Tīrthaprabandha recordings: the shared folder holds only Dakṣiṇa-prabandha 1–19 (19 files); the ~287 the lead remembers are elsewhere.
* 48 kHz masters of a decided voice; the recording protocol exists, nothing has been recorded to it.
* A pilot model, an evaluation harness, a HUMAN_REVIEW.csv workflow.

## 5. What data we already possess (verified from files)

| | |
|---|---|
| audio files reachable | 2,719 (1.3 GB, git-ignored, re-fetchable with `--fetch`; Drive folders now public) |
| total duration | 22.57 h |
| grade A (clean) | 6.52 h · grade A+B 18.52 h · grade D 3.6 h |
| text↔audio pairs, confidence ≥ 0.7 | 1,985 files, 15.81 h |
| text↔audio pairs, confidence ≥ 0.9 | 1,999 files, 8.89 h |
| **usable for training now** (grade A/B, confidence ≥ 0.9, plausible duration, not a duplicate) | **1,454 files, 6.02 h** |
| pairs with a named metre | 88.6 % of the ≥0.7 pairs |
| pairs with laghu/guru string | 100 % of the ≥0.7 pairs (engine output; the 11.4 % without a metre name still have scans) |
| unmatched audio (no confident text) | 307 files (110 of them the Nāmāvali, text not in DGE) |
| sample rates | 48 kHz 1,034 · 44.1 kHz 521 · 11.025 kHz 989 |

Sources: DGE-linked (Sumadhva Vijaya 989, Rāghavendra Vijaya 576, Prahlāda-Narasiṃha 11) 6.9 h; Drive (Bhāgavata
Sāroddhāra 436, Bhagavad Gītā 7 adhyāyas 406, Hari Vāyu Stuti 20, 'vsn' 106) 15.25 h.

Caveats the owner should know: the Gītā recordings run 46–120 s per verse (5–8× a single rendition) and must be
segmented before use; the Sāroddhāra recordings (2.1 h, grade A) are the best audio we have and their text was
imported and verified only today; Sumadhva Vijaya is the largest corpus but low-bitrate.

## 6. What data still needs preparation

1. Decide the voice → tag every file `speaker = <name> | other` (P0 in `KAMADHENU_TODO.md`).
2. Listen to 2 Gītā files and 2 'vsn' files and describe them → segmentation rule for 511 files.
3. Human-verify the 38 structurally safe reference candidates (`reference_bank.html`).
4. Share or upload the blocked Drive folders (Tīrthaprabandha).
5. Fix the 46 duplicate / 5 broken files in the audio repo.

## 7. What can be automated (and is)

Inventory, QC, mapping, chandas analysis, subsets, reference-bank ranking, dashboards, deployment of the Space,
measurement of GPU seconds, dataset validation (Phase 4, next), pilot selection (Phase 6), evaluation scripts.

## 8. What requires human action

The five items in §6, the HF write token as a GitHub secret (`HF_TOKEN`), and every paid step (none proposed yet).
