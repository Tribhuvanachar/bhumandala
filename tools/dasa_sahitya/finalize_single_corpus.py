DGE — Dasa Sahitya: fold the remaining local-asset composers into one corpus
=============================================================================

Step 4 of dasa_sahitya_local/ARCHITECTURE.md's "Path to one folder" plan.
The 12 composers confirmed as the SAME person across sources were already
folded in by merge_confirmed_composers.py. This script handles everything
else that's left in dasa_sahitya_local/ after that:

  - dasa1/dasaru/*.json           -- 123 composers with no web-side match
                                      (5 name-root-alike ones were checked by
                                      the project lead and confirmed to be
                                      DIFFERENT people from their web-side
                                      candidates -- so every remaining dasa1
                                      composer becomes its own new composer
                                      file here, none merged into an existing
                                      one)
  - raw_dump/dasaru/ugabhoga.json -- 278 unattributed compositions, folded
                                      into the existing composers/untitled.json
                                      bucket via the same fingerprint dedupe()
                                      used everywhere else in this pipeline,
                                      so an exact duplicate against the web
                                      crawl's own untitled pile collapses
                                      instead of appearing twice

collection_padagalu/ is already empty -- its composers were among the 12
confirmed duplicates and got merged out by the earlier pass.

After this runs, dasa_sahitya_local/ holds nothing new to review; every
composition lives under dge/data/dasa_sahitya/composers/. Re-running this
script is safe as long as dasa_sahitya_local/dasa1/dasaru/ and
raw_dump/dasaru/ugabhoga.json still exist locally (they are NOT deleted by
this script -- only referenced -- since they live on the
dasa-sahitya-local-dist branch, not in this checkout, when run for real).

Usage:
    python3 tools/dasa_sahitya/finalize_single_corpus.py \
        --local-dir /path/to/a/checkout/of/dasa-sahitya-local-dist
