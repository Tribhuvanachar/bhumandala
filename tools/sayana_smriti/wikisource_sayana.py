"""Import Sāyaṇa's Ṛgveda-bhāṣya into DGE from Sanskrit Wikisource.

Why this source rather than the archive.org scan (see SOURCES.md §5): the text
is transcribed rather than OCR'd, it is wrapped in a named template
``{{सायणभाष्यम्|…}}`` so extraction is a parse instead of a fuzzy match, its
licence is stated (CC BY-SA), and it covers 1,022 of the Ṛgveda's 1,028 sūktas.

How the alignment works, and why it is self-verifying
-----------------------------------------------------
Each page holds one sūkta. Inside the template the edition prints, per mantra
and in order::

    <saṃhitā-pāṭha, accented>   … ॥N
    <pada-pāṭha, accented>      … ॥N
    <pada-pāṭha, plain>         … ॥N
    <Sāyaṇa's gloss on mantra N>

DGE already holds all four of the first three forms' sources — ``samhita_patha``
and ``pada_patha``, accented and plain — for every one of the 10,552 mantras.
So a cut is never made on a number alone: the number ``N`` must agree *and* the
text immediately above the marker must resemble the mantra DGE already has. A
wrong cut therefore cannot look right, which is the property the archive.org
route was built for and the reason its logic is reused here verbatim
(``skeleton``/``similarity`` are imported from ``archive_sayana``).

The gloss for mantra N runs from the last marker numbered N that matches, up to
the first matching marker for N+1 — i.e. up to the top of the next mantra's
printed saṃhitā-pāṭha.
