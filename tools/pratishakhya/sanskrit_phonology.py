"""A real, scoped Sanskrit sandhi engine for the Krama generator.

Built in direct response to a reviewed spec (11 Sep 2026) that correctly
identified the previous RV 1.1 generator as a hand-aligned reconstruction
dressed up as generation: it looked up each pair's already-correct form
from DGE's own attested samhita_patha instead of computing it. This module
is the computation this generator was missing -- `samhita_join(w1, w2)`
derives a pair's sandhi'd form from the two BARE pada words, citing which
rule fired, rather than reading the answer off ground truth.

SCOPE, stated explicitly rather than implied by what's present: this
covers the segmental (vowel + consonant/visarga) sandhi classes needed to
reproduce RV 1.1's own attested pairs -- Paṭala 2 (vowel: savarṇa-dīrgha,
guṇa, vṛddhi, yaṇ, the eṅ-a elision convention) and Paṭala 4 (consonant/
visarga: the sa/eṣa exception, i/u-class visarga before a vowel, a-class
visarga before voiced/unvoiced, word-final n/m/t behaviour). It does NOT
cover: Vedic-specific classes named in Paṭala 2 by name only so far
(praśliṣṭa, kṣaipra, abhinihita, prakṛtibhāva -- ordinary classical vowel
sandhi is applied uniformly here instead, which is a real gap, not silently
assumed equivalent) accented syllables (Paṭala 3 -- accents are stripped
before this module runs and are not restored; see krama_engine.py), Nati
(Paṭala 5), Dhvanyāgama (Paṭala 6), or Pluti (Paṭala 7-9). Each of those is
a named, separate engineering task per the reviewed spec's own Paṭala 5-9
sections -- not something this module quietly approximates.

Every join returns which rule fired (a short rule_id, not a paṭala/sūtra
number -- this engine implements the GENERAL classical/Vedic phonological
classes named in the sūtras' own definitional Paṭala 1-2, not a citation to
one specific Krama-Paṭala sūtra, which is a different kind of citation --
see krama_engine.py for the Krama-Paṭala rule citations layered on top of
this module's output) plus, where accuracy is uncertain, an explicit
low-confidence flag -- never a silent guess presented as equal-confidence
to an attested case.

TWO KNOWN, UNRESOLVED GAPS surfaced by chain-reconstruction validation
(reconstruct_chain(), checked against DGE's own attested samhita_patha by
tools/pratishakhya/regenerate_krama_rv_1_1.py) -- named here rather than
silently producing a wrong answer with ordinary-looking confidence:

1. RV 1.1.7's "bharantaH"+"aa" -> attested "bharanta emasi" shows the
   visarga dropping ENTIRELY before this aa, not converting to "o" as the
   general a-class-visarga-before-voiced rule (this module's own
   "visarga_a_class_before_voiced") gives ("bharanto aa"). Neither this
   engine's classical answer nor a-guess is confirmed correct -- this
   looks like a Vedic-specific visarga-lopa variant (the Prati'saakhya's
   own "bahulam chandasi" latitude) not yet backed by a specific sutra in
   krama_kramahetu_rules.json. Do not add an ad hoc special case for this
   without first finding which sutra (if any) actually licenses it.
2. The indic_transliteration library's SLP1 scheme cannot distinguish
   "र्ऋ" (a bare consonant, then an independent vowel -- e.g. from a
   visarga-to-r insertion before a vocalic-r/rr word) from "रृ" (that same
   consonant with a DEPENDENT vowel-matra) -- both round-trip to the
   identical SLP1 string ("rf"). _finish_consonant_then_vowel() works
   around this for a SINGLE join by keeping the two chunks as separate
   Devanagari strings, but once that correct output is fed back into
   samhita_join a second time (as reconstruct_chain() does, building up a
   whole ardharca), it gets re-transliterated to SLP1 as one piece,
   collapsing the distinction -- confirmed via RV 1.1.2's chain
   ("puurvebhi-r-Rzibhi..." loses its virama on the second hop, rendering
   "पूर्वेभिरृषिभिः" instead of "पूर्वेभिर्ऋषिभिः"). A real fix needs
   either a private marker that survives round-tripping through this
   scheme, or bypassing indic_transliteration's SLP1 for this one
   character class -- not attempted here; flagging it precisely was
   judged more valuable than a rushed patch.

    (RV 1.1.2's puurvebhiH+RSibhiH -> puurvebhir.RSibhiH) that ONLY
    vocalic-r/rr (SLP1 f/F) needs to render as its own INDEPENDENT letter
    rather than merging as a dependent matra on the preceding consonant
    -- "र्ऋषिभिः" (bare र्, then independent ऋ), not "रृषिभिः" (र् read
    as if ऋ were its OWN vowel). Every other vowel (verified against
    RV 1.1.2's RSibhiH+iiDyaH -> RSibhir.iiDyaH, attested as one merged
    "री") merges normally as a dependent matra -- transliterating the
    whole string in one pass already does that correctly, so only the
    f/F case needs the separate-transliterate-then-concatenate
    workaround (verified: transliterating a string that ends in a bare
    consonant always ends in an explicit virama).

    without it, this correct Devanagari output, if fed back into
    samhita_join a second time (reconstruct_chain() does exactly this),
    gets re-transliterated to SLP1 as one flat "rf"/"rF" and can render
    back WRONG (as the dependent-matra reading) on that second pass --
    confirmed as a real bug before this fix, and confirmed the ZWNJ
    survives at least 4 consecutive re-joins after it. See strip_zwnj_markers()
