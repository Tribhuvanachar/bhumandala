"""Cross-check rigveda_pratishakhya/data.json (Layer A, Sanskrit Library)
against VedaVishtaram (Layer B: vedavishtaram.in/lakshanam/rp.html --
Saunaka's text with Uvata's Bhasya and Vishnumitra's Vrtti) and attach
Layer B's sutra text + Bhasya to every item where the two sources could
be aligned.

Why this exists, and its real limits (read before trusting the output):

1. VedaVishtaram's own sutra numbering does NOT always match Layer A's.
   Layer A (Cardona/Scharf) sometimes folds a preceding illustrative
   Vedic-verse quotation into the SAME numbered "line" as the following
   terse sutra; VedaVishtaram keeps that quotation as unnumbered "text"
   above the sutra div and numbers only the terse core. This was
   confirmed directly by hand for many patala-10/11 sutras (e.g. Layer
   A's "10.3" is VedaVishtaram's five-line illustrative verse PLUS its
   sutra 3 "atItyaitAnyavasyanti"). Total per-patala counts can still
   coincidentally agree (patala 10 = 22 in both, patala 11 = 71 in both)
   even though individual sutra boundaries differ -- agreement in count
   is not proof of 1:1 correspondence, which is why this was checked by
   spot-comparing actual text content, not just index equality.

2. Patala 10 (Krama) and patala 11 (Kramahetu) were checked this way
   extensively (a majority of both patalas' entries individually
   spot-checked against VedaVishtaram's text) and the same-index
   correspondence holds reliably there -- Layer A's text at (patala,
   sutra) is consistently either identical to, or a superset (with a
   preceding annotation prefix) of, VedaVishtaram's text at the SAME
   index. UNCERTAIN_RESOLUTIONS below is a hand-verified table built
   from that checking, with a citation for every resolution: either a
   direct VV match, or an explicit corpus-internal pattern (e.g. "purva"
   confirmed directly 6+ times elsewhere in this same text) -- never a
   silent guess.

3. Outside patala 10-11, that same-index correspondence is NOT verified
   and, going by the patala-level count mismatches already logged in
   dge/RV_PRATISHAKHYA_KRAMA_ARCHITECTURE.md sec.4a.1 (patala 2: 82 vs 41
   sutras -- a large, unexplained gap), likely does NOT hold uniformly.
   This script still attaches same-index VV text/Bhasya there (it's
   useful raw data either way) but marks it index_verified=false, and
   only resolves an uncertain [?] reading elsewhere in the corpus when
   an automated same-index substring match succeeds unambiguously (the
   "algorithmic OK" cases) -- never by pattern-guessing outside patala
   10-11, since the corpus-wide patterns used for patala 10-11 haven't
   been checked for validity in other patalas' technical vocabulary.
