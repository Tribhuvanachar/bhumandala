"""The actual Krama generator: computes Krama-patha from raw Pada-patha
words using sanskrit_phonology.samhita_join (a real sandhi engine) and
pratishakhya_classify's predicates, rather than looking up precomputed
pair strings. Built in direct response to the reviewed spec (11 Sep
2026) that identified the previous generator as a hand-aligned
reconstruction, not a generator.

Pipeline per ardharca (matches
dge/RV_PRATISHAKHYA_KRAMA_ARCHITECTURE.md sec.5's diagram, for the slice
of it this pass actually implements -- Patala 1-2/4 phonology plus
Patala 10's structural/Parigraha rules; Patala 3 accent, 5-9 Nati/
Dhvanyagama/Pluti, and most of Patala 11 remain future work, not silently
assumed done):

    Pada words
        -> sutra 10.3 monosyllable-exception detection (special pattern)
        -> sutra 10.2 base pairing, via samhita_join (real sandhi)
        -> sutra 10.7-10.9 Parigraha trigger detection (requires_parigraha)
        -> sutra 10.12-10.16 sthita/upasthita/sthitopasthita rendering
        -> Krama output, every unit citing which rule(s) fired

Every unit dict carries THREE independent, non-substitutable signals (per
the 11 Sep 2026 review of the first regenerated-output run, which found
"confidence" alone was being read as if it meant "verified correct" --
it never did, and conflating them is exactly the failure mode flagged):

  "status": "canonical" (produced by applying the general rule engine
      uniformly to this word sequence) vs "candidate_reconstruction"
      (this session's own generalization of a SINGLE cited worked example
      -- currently only sutra 10.3's units -- never independently
      confirmed against a second source). A consumer that wants only
      source-confirmed output filters on this field.
  "confidence" ("high"/"low", set by sanskrit_phonology.samhita_join):
      how sure the PHONOLOGICAL RULE CLASSIFIER is that it picked the
      right branch for this segmental context. This says nothing about
      whether the resulting Vedic form is independently attested.
  "chain_reconstruction" (added per-ARDHARCA, not per-unit, by
      tools/pratishakhya/regenerate_krama_rv_1_1.py as a VALIDATE-mode
      pass, not by this module): whether folding samhita_join across the
      WHOLE ardharca reproduces DGE's own attested continuous
      samhita_patha for it. This is a real, checkable fact about the
      phonology engine, but it is NOT proof of philological correctness
      either -- reproducing DGE's own Samhita only shows internal
      self-consistency with this repo's other data, not agreement with an
      attested Krama-patha edition (still an open question -- see the
      architecture doc sec.10). It is deliberately per-ardharca rather
      than per-unit: an individual Krama pair is computed against only
      its immediate neighbour, but that word's form in the continuous
      chain often depends on a LATER neighbour too, so per-unit
      substring-matching against continuous text produces false
      mismatches (a real mistake made and then fixed in this session --
      see regenerate_krama_rv_1_1.py's own module docstring).
