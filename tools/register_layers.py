"""Idempotently register every dge/data/**/data.json in library.json's granthas[].

The reader (core.js) only fetches content that has an entry in library.json, and
gen_library_status.py only counts taxonomy leaves that resolve to such an entry.
New importer output (a fresh layer folder like <kanda>/saartha, the bhagavad_gita
section, or darshana/vedanta/advaita/shankara_bhashya/**) therefore stays invisible until it is listed
here. This tool scans the data tree and appends any data.json that is missing,
with populated = (it has content). Safe to run repeatedly; run AFTER an importer.
