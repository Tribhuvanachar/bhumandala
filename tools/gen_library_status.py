# Counts are cross-referenced against data/library.json's granthas[] list,
# NOT derived by guessing a file path from taxonomy.json alone. Some
# taxonomy leaves nest an extra layer folder under themselves -- today just
# "mula" (the root text, leaving room for a future sibling commentary
# layer) -- used across Ramayana/Mahabharata's kanda/parva leaves, several
# monolithic Puranas, and all of Sarvamoola's real, live content. Guessing
# "<leaf>/data.json" directly misses every one of those (it lands on an
# unrelated placeholder file instead) and would keep reporting a leaf as
# empty forever even after real content is merged. library.json's own path
# per entry is already correct for every leaf either way, so it's the one
# thing this script should trust.
