"""Build dge/guru-parampara/data/pratima.json -- the deity/pratima layer
that DGE_Madhva_Acquisition_Architecture.md §26 calls for and that,
until now, did not exist anywhere in this corpus (parampara.json and
mathas.json model saints and institutions, not individual worshipped
images).

Unlike mathas.json/parampara.json's people/places, this file is NOT
auto-derived from parampara.json -- it is built from acquired source data
(currently: dge/sources/vyasaraja_anjaneya_app/), one source per run, never
guessed. Re-run this after adding a new pratima source to dge/sources/.

Current source: the ~732-idol Hanuman/Anjaneya network traditionally
attributed to Sri Vyasatirtha's consecrations (see parampara.json's
vyasatirtha node: "traditionally consecrated 732 Mukhyaprana icons" --
this file is the first structured data backing that prose claim). 323 of
the ~732 are in the source app; the rest are not yet acquired anywhere.

gps is deliberately left null here: the source only gives a Google Maps
share-link and a *local* Plus Code (e.g. "6RPH+V8 <place>"), which cannot
be decoded to real lat/lng without a reference point per entry (a local
Plus Code is only unambiguous relative to a known nearby location) --
guessing that reference would risk a wrong coordinate, which is worse than
none. map_url and plus_code are kept as-is for a human (or a future,
careful geocoding pass) to resolve.
