build_sandhi_split_index.py — sandhi-vicheda for the corpus's own compounds,
using sanskrit_parser's rule-based Sandhi splitter, validated against the
word lists this repo already ships.

WHY A SECOND SANDHI INDEX. build_sandhi_index.py (Vidyut) deliberately
indexes only the six vowel-sandhi categories it can name an Ashtadhyayi
sutra for, and its output lives on a CDN rather than in the repo — which is
why the Sandhi word-tool does nothing on a local checkout. The project lead
asked (9 Sep 2026) for "local sandhi splitting using the open-source
sanskrit_parser library's Sandhi class, specifically the split_all method",
integrated with the dhatu data so matches can be highlighted. That library
splits consonant and visarga boundaries too, so this covers cases the
Vidyut pass skips, and the output is committed so it works offline.

    pip install sanskrit_parser
    python3 tools/build_sandhi_split_index.py --min-count 20

THE PROBLEM WITH split_all, AND THE FIX. It returns EVERY phonetically
possible split, not the right one: तच्छ्रुत्वा yields 20, among them
'g' + 'acCati'-style noise and 'rAH' + 'masyEva'. Raw output is unusable in
a reader. So each candidate is validated against word lists already in this
repo, and only splits whose BOTH halves are real words survive:

  _morph/                     93,143 inflected forms Vidyut resolved for
                              this corpus (nominal and verbal)
  prakriya/formindex/        204,970 inflected VERB forms, every root
  upasarga_artha.json         the 22 upasargas, first-half only

तच्छ्रुत्वा then keeps exactly तत् + श्रुत्वा (and its तद् variant), and
रामस्यैव keeps रामस्य + एव. That validation is also what makes the
highlighting the lead asked for possible: each half records WHICH list
recognised it, so the reader's popup can mark a half that is a real verb
form — a dhatu — differently from one that is merely a known nominal.

SCOPE, AND WHY IT IS CAPPED. split_all costs ~0.39 s per word single-core.
The corpus has 5,001,516 distinct forms; even the 388,122 seen five times
or more would be days of compute. Two filters cut that to something
honest: a word _morph ALREADY resolves is not a sandhi compound needing a
split, and a word shorter than --min-len cannot usefully be one. What
remains at --min-count 20 is ~40k words. The manifest records the real
figures rather than implying the corpus is covered; a word not in the index
falls back exactly as it does today.

NOT A SENTENCE SEGMENTER, and only ONE boundary per word: a three-member
compound is not recursively split. Both would cost far more compute and are
a separate undertaking.
