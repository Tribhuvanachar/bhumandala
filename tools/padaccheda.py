"""
padaccheda.py — पदच्छेदः: cutting a written Sanskrit word back into the words
that were joined to make it, using only data this repository already ships.

THE PROBLEM IS NOT WHITESPACE. Sanskrit text already carries spaces at most
word boundaries; what it does not carry is a boundary where sandhi has welded
two words into one written token. Sumadhva Vijaya 1.1 writes

    नारायणायाखिलकारणाय

which is नारायणाय + अखिलकारणाय, fused at आय + अ → आया. A splitter that only
looked for substrings would never find the second word, because अखिलकारणाय's
initial अ is not present in the written form at all — it was absorbed. So the
split has to UNDO the junction, not merely locate it.

THE METHOD. Model the token as a graph: nodes are character positions 0..n,
and an edge i→j means "a real word occupies S[i:j], possibly after restoring
what sandhi took from its end, and leaves the next word starting at j with
what sandhi took from ITS beginning". Every edge is validated against the
shipped vocabulary — 295,958 words: कोश headwords, 205k tiṅanta forms, 49k
kṛdantas — so a candidate that is not a real word is discarded rather than
offered. Then take the cheapest path from 0 to n.

That validation is the whole difference between this and a combinatorial
splitter, which will happily offer न + आरायणायाखिलकारणाय.

COST, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. Two words that are both common beat five
that are individually possible. Each piece costs a fixed amount for existing
at all (so the shortest analysis wins ties), minus a term for how often the
corpus actually uses it, plus a penalty for being very short — a two-character
piece is usually the splitter finding a particle inside a longer word rather
than a real boundary.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a parser: it offers no case, number or agreement,
and it cannot tell a correct split from a merely possible one when both halves
are real words. Where a text ships a human-made padaccheda, that is used and
this never runs. Accuracy is measured, not asserted — see
tools/build_padaccheda.py --evaluate.
