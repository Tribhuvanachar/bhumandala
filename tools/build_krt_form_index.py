build_krt_form_index.py — reverse lookup from a kṛdanta (verb-derived word)
surface form, e.g. लभ्यः, back to (root, kṛt-pratyaya), for the reader's
word-tool "Shabda" click.

WHY THIS EXISTS. उवाच/परस्य-style deep-linking (tools/build_prakriya_form_index.py,
data/.../formindex/) already covers finite tiṅanta verb forms and nominal
declensions. It does NOT cover kṛdantas — words like लभ्यः ("obtainable",
लभ् + यत्) that are grammatically verb-derived but used AS nominals in a
sentence. A reader selecting one and tapping "Shabda" got a genuinely wrong
answer: no exact match in the Śabdapāṭha nominal-stem database (correctly —
kṛdantas are not stored there), followed by a plain substring fallback that
matched the query as a raw substring INSIDE an unrelated word's declension
table (लभ्यः is literally a substring of वलभ्यः, वलभी's own द्वितीया
बहुवचन) and silently opened that as if it were the answer. Confirmed live,
reported with a screenshot, 20 Aug 2026.

WHAT THIS INDEXES. tools/build_prakriya.py already derives each root's
kṛdanta STEMS (data/vedanga/vyakarana/prakriya/<gana>/<code>.json's
"krt" array — kta/ktavatu/ktvA/tumun/Satf/SAnac/tavya/anIyar/yat/Rvul/
tfc/lyuw). A stem is not a complete word a reader would click on in running
text; it still needs a case ending. This script is NOT a declension engine
— it generates a SMALL, deliberately limited set of the most common surface
forms per stem shape, not a full paradigm:

  - Stems ending in an implicit-अ consonant (the common case — kta, SAnac,
    tavya, anIyar, yat, Rvul, lyuw: लब्ध, लभमान, लब्धव्य, लम्भनीय, लभ्य,
    लम्भक, लम्भन) get three candidates: +ः (nom sg masc), +म् (nom/acc sg
    neut), +आ (nom sg fem, imperfect for an ī-stem feminine reading, but the
    single most common fem citation form for this stem shape).
  - tfc (ऋ-stem agent nouns like लब्धृ) additionally gets its own ऋ->आ
    nominative (लब्धृ -> लब्धा), the one irregular case worth the extra rule.
  - Already-complete stems (ktvA/tumun, genuinely indeclinable; ktavatu/Satf,
    whose own nominative is NOT a simple suffix — कृतवत् -> कृतवान्, भवत् ->
    भवन् — and irregular enough that guessing it wrong would be worse than
    not indexing it at all) are indexed ONLY as their bare stem.

AMBIGUITY: EVERY ROOT, NOT THE LOWEST-NUMBERED ONE. This used to be
first-write-wins over roots in Dhātupāṭha code order — documented as a
heuristic, and wrong in the single most common case in the language. कृत्वा
is the ktvā of both कृ॒ञ् हिंसायाम् (05.0007, "to injure") and डुकृ॒ञ् करणे
(08.0010, "to do"). Code order files it under 05.0007, so every "having done"
in the corpus was counted as an injuring: 29,938 occurrences on a root that
means the opposite of what the reader is looking at (reported by the project
lead, 9 Sep 2026).

There is no honest way to pick one here, so this picks none: a form maps to
the LIST of every (root, kṛt-pratyaya) that produces it. The readers already
know how to offer a choice — the Dhātu popup has shown all matching roots
since 8 Sep — and tools/build_dhatu_prayoga_index.py uses the list to
separate occurrences it can attribute with certainty from ones it cannot.
The same change was made to build_prakriya_form_index.py for tiṅanta forms.

Sharded by first Devanagari codepoint, same scheme as formindex/, so one
word-click fetches one small shard.
