"""Where is each dhātu form actually used in the library? (धातुप्रयोगसूची)

For every surface form the site can already name -- the 204,974 tiṅanta
forms in prakriya/formindex/ and the 48,890 kṛdanta forms in
prakriya/krtindex/, both keyed to a Dhātupāṭha code and a cell -- this walks
every verse and prose unit of the corpus, records each exact occurrence, and
writes two mirror-image indexes:

  by_dhatu/<gana>/<code>.json     code → {total, forms: {cell → {n, e:[examples]}}}
                                  (the examples a dhātu page shows under a form)
  by_grantha/<slug>.json          unit → [[word, code, cell], …]
                                  (the chips a verse card shows, linking back)
  manifest.json                   totals, per-dhātu totals for leaderboards,
                                  per-branch totals, build info

Why a stored index when intellisense.js and dhatu.js deliberately route
"other occurrences" through the global search: search is STRING-precise (it
finds the letters भवति wherever they occur), this is FORM-precise (it knows
भवति is 01.0001 भू, लट् प्रथमपुरुष एकवचन, and can therefore count, rank and
list examples per cell, per dhātu and per branch). The two answer different
questions and this one cannot be asked of a substring search at all.

Precision over recall: only exact, word-bounded matches count. A word fused
by sandhi (भवत्येव) is not found -- fine, the list is examples, not a census
-- and the very short or notoriously ambiguous forms (ते, स, मे, याति as a
noun …) are skipped by length and a small stoplist rather than counted
wrongly.

HOMOGRAPHS: COUNTED TWICE, NEVER CREDITED ONCE. A surface form does not
always name one root. कृत्वा is the ktvā of both कृ॒ञ् हिंसायाम् (05.0007,
"to injure") and डुकृ॒ञ् करणे (08.0010, "to do"), and the form indexes used
to answer with whichever root came first in Dhātupāṭha order -- so all 29,938
"having done"s in the corpus were filed under "having injured" (the project
lead, 9 Sep 2026). 12.9% of tiṅanta forms and 22% of kṛdanta forms are
ambiguous this way, so this is not a rounding error.

Both indexes now return EVERY reading, and every count here is split in two:

  n   CERTAIN   the form has exactly one reading in the whole corpus of
                forms; the occurrence is this root's, and nothing else's
  sn  SHARED    the form is a homograph; the occurrence is recorded in full
                against EVERY candidate root, and flagged as shared

Shared counts deliberately do not sum to the number of occurrences -- one
कृत्वा is counted for 05.0007 AND for 08.0010, because that is the honest
statement of what is known: one of them wrote it and we cannot say which.
Anything that ranks (the leaderboards, the chip a verse card links to) ranks
on the certain count, which is evidence rather than a guess. What is NOT done
here: splitting an ambiguous occurrence fractionally between candidates by
some assumed baseline. There is no such baseline in this repository, and a
made-up weight would give a wrong number the appearance of a measured one.

root_weights.json falls out of the certain counts: code -> certain total, the
one piece of corpus evidence available for ordering candidates when a reader
tool has to show something first. It is a ranking hint and never a count.
