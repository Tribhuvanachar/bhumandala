recover_structure.py — put back the shape the import flattened away.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
import_dvaitavedanta.py keeps a breadcrumb as a list of strings and throws the
tree away. So the corpus can be read page by page but cannot answer "what
contains this, and what else does that contain" — and a Dvaita reader asks
that first.

The tree was never missing from the pages. Every leaf renders the grantha's
whole navigation as nested <ul class="sub-menu">, each node carrying its own
content id and a data-level. This walks that markup and writes the parent /
child relation out as data.

It reads the HTTP cache rather than the network. The cache is keyed by SHA1 of
the URL and holds the pages exactly as fetched, so this costs nothing and can
be re-run at will -- but it also means the cache is the raw material, and
recovering more later depends on it still existing.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not invent an adhikaraṇa level. The source tree is
grantha > adhyāya/section > pāda > group > leaf, with no adhikaraṇa among
them; adhikaraṇa names occur only inside page headings. Grouping leaves under
an adhikaraṇa is a derivation to be made and marked as derived, separately,
and confirmed by someone who knows the text.
