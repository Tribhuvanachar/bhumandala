"""Extract the dvaitavedanta.in corpus into dge/data/darshana/vedanta/dvaita/DvaitaVedanta/.

Runs on GitHub Actions (open network egress). It does NOT run inside the Cowork
sandbox, which has no scraping egress to this host — that is by design and
matches the established DGE import workflow (see tools/dasa_sahitya/).

Pipeline per grantha
  1. discover  fetch the seed leaf, harvest the full sidebar -> the leaf id set
  2. fetch     GET each leaf through a resumable on-disk cache
  3. parse     breadcrumb -> hierarchy, stacked commentary layers -> items
  4. emit      one data.json per commentary layer, DGE canonical shape
  5. track     _extract_status.json + a GitHub step summary

Design notes
  * Sidebar harvesting beats id brute-force: the id space has gaps that return
    HTTP 500, and one leaf page carries the whole grantha tree already.
  * The cache is keyed by SHA1 of the URL, so re-runs resume for free and a
    failed shard never costs the others their work.
  * Nothing is written unless --write is passed; --dry-run is the default so a
    parser regression cannot land 15k pages of bad JSON.
