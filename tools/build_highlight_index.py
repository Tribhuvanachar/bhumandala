build_highlight_index.py — the word-presence index behind the reader's
highlighting: which words in a verse or a commentary are ones we can actually
say something about.

WHY THIS AND NOT THE INDEXES WE ALREADY HAVE. The project lead asked (9 Sep
2026) for "dhatus in the sloka highlighted with a special background color"
and for "matched koshas in the commentary" to carry the same mark. Both
answers already exist in this repo, but neither in a shape a renderer can
consult:

  prakriya/formindex/       204,970 tiṅanta forms, and prakriya/krtindex/
  prakriya/krtindex/        48,886 kṛdantas, both bucketed by FIRST LETTER
                            ONLY — the अ shard alone is 3.5 MB. Fetching it
                            to decide the colour of one word is absurd.
  kosha/<cat>/<dict>/e/     the dictionaries themselves, 54 MB of glosses,
                            of which highlighting needs precisely the
                            headword list and nothing else.

So this reduces both to the one bit each that highlighting needs — "is this
word a verb form", "is this word a कोश headword" — and shards them two
characters deep, which is what turns a 3.5 MB fetch into a ~10 KB one. The
gloss, the paradigm, the root: all still come from the full indexes, but
only once the reader actually taps the word.

COVERAGE IS DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE. The कोश headwords here come from the
dictionaries shipped IN THIS REPO; at runtime the reader's tap resolves
against appConfig.koshaDataBase, a larger mirror on a CDN. That asymmetry is
the safe direction: every word this marks is one the tap can answer, and
words only the CDN set knows go unmarked rather than marked-and-empty. If
the two are ever brought level, rebuild from whichever is the superset.

WHAT A MARK MEANS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. A highlight is a promise that
tapping gets you somewhere, not a claim of analysis. A कोश mark means the
written form IS a headword — an inflected form in a commentary generally is
not, and is honestly left unmarked rather than guessed at. Nothing here
does morphology; that is what tapping the word is for.
