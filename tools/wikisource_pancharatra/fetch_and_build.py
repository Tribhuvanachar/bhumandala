fetch_and_build.py -- fetches every chapter subpage of a Sanskrit Wikisource
Pancharatra Samhita via the MediaWiki API, parses the wikitext, and writes
a data.json matching the existing pancharatra_samhitas on-disk shape
(schema: generic, items: [{id, reference, shlokas: [{number, sanskrit_text}]}]).

Parsing quirks this handles, found and fixed by testing against real pages
before trusting it at scale (see dge/PENDING.md, 23 Aug entry):
- Critical-apparatus footnote blocks, bounded by dash-lines, removed via a
  line-based state machine (a monolithic regex mis-paired dash-lines on
  real data and silently ate 62 real verses in testing -- caught by
  counting verse-ref markers before/after, not assumed correct).
- Inline footnote-marker digits (e.g. "13parapara..."), stripped after
  protecting the "|| N.M ||"-style verse-ref markers with a NON-numeric
  placeholder (a numeric placeholder had its own digits eaten by the same
  strip step it was meant to survive -- also caught by testing, not assumed).
- Editorial subheading lines (tab-indented, no danda punctuation at all)
  removed -- but ONLY lines with no danda, since indented VERSE lines
  (padas continuing a speaker's dialogue) are also tab-indented in this
  source and must not be dropped; caught because an early version used
  "no || anywhere on this line" as the test, which wrongly ate a verse's
  first pada whenever its own closing || fell on the next line instead.
- Chapter-title line(s) at the front extracted via a no-danda/no-trailing-
  dash heuristic (title lines are the only front-matter lines with neither),
  rather than a fixed line count -- chapter 1 has 2 title lines, chapter 2
  has 1, so a fixed count silently swallowed chapter 2's own subheading
  into a phantom "chapter_title" on first attempt.
- The generic "shuklambaradharam..." Ganesha-dhyana verse, a printer's-
  convention invocation with no verse-ref marker of its own, stripped by
  EXACT text match (not a heuristic) so it can't accidentally eat real
  content in a chapter that happens to lack it.

# not a chapter.verse pair, and its editorial apparatus -- variant
# readings, uncertain readings, section headings -- turns out to come in
# far more shapes than first appeared from a first, small sample (checked
# directly at full scale, not assumed from 2 chapters to hold for all 33):
# a bare digit or "*" marker attached straight to a word with the actual
# footnote text on its own line below; a marker-less inline variant
# spelling attached straight to a word ("घर्मे(र्मो)"); an uncertain
# reading marked with a trailing "?" instead of a marker character
# ("तम्(त्?)"); a parenthesized section heading immediately followed by
# " - " and real verse text *on the same line* ("(प्रधानात्...) -
# विभक्तं..."); and a bracketed variant of a *whole pada*, in either
# round parens or square brackets, sometimes standing alone on its own
# line and sometimes trailing real content on the same line
# ("...यथावद्वक्तुमर्हसि। [नारदो ब्रह्मणः ...]"). Chasing each shape with
# its own regex kept missing the next one; the one property genuinely
# true across all of them, checked directly against a real chapter's
# paren/bracket counts (always balanced, bar one stray trailing
# character in dropped tail text past the last verse), is that this
# source never uses "(...)" or "[...]" for real verse content at all --
# so instead every bracketed span, wherever it falls and however deep it
# nests, is apparatus and is stripped outright, inside-out via a
# fixed-point loop so a nested case like "(*. ... (Adyar Library Ms.)
# ... नीतः)" fully resolves.
#
# A recognizable Sanskrit chapter-colophon idiom, "<name> नाम <ordinal>
# पटलः।", appears as the true closing colophon (harmless -- it falls
# after the last verse ref and is never assigned to any unit) but was
# also found duplicated as a *front-matter* line before chapter 1's own
# verse 1 -- there it would otherwise leak into verse 1's body (it
# carries a danda, so the plain no-danda title-zone heuristic doesn't

# Lakshmitantram shares Jayakhyasamhita's per-chapter single-number ref
# convention, but its apparatus is a genuinely different shape, checked
# directly against adhyaya 1's own raw wikitext rather than assumed to
# match just because both share that ref convention: variant-reading
# footnotes are square-bracket-wrapped, referenced by an inline "[N]"
# marker attached straight to a word (handled by the same generic
# bracket-span stripping already built for Jayakhyasamhita) -- but each
# verse's own textual commentary sits on a *tab-indented* line right
# after its ref, with no bracket or paren of its own at all
# ("\t1. नम इति विशिष्टोपायस्य..."), sometimes reduced to a placeholder
# dash-run when there's no variant ("\t8. - - - - - - - - - - -"), and
# at least once (adhyaya 1, after verse 4) continuing across several
# *more* tab-indented lines quoting a complete extra benedictory verse
# under a "टिप्पणी" ("gloss") sub-heading, itself just another tab-
# indented line. One rule covers the whole family: real verse text in
# this source is never itself tab-indented (confirmed directly -- the
# front matter's own tab-indented title lines are already consumed by
# the title-zone extraction below before this runs, so this only ever
# touches genuine apparatus), so any line starting with a tab is
# dropped outright, however many of them run together.

# Padmasamhita (checked directly against a chapter sample from each of
# its 4 padas, not assumed to share one convention just because they're
# part of the same work) uses the same chapter.verse ref pairing
# Ahirbudhnyasamhita/Vishnusamhita do, but each pada's own editorial
# apparatus differs: yogapada wraps section headings in asterisks
# ("*योगद्वैविध्यम्*"), kriyapada's headings carry no delimiter at all,
# just a bare "." where a verse line would instead end in a danda
# ("स्थानद्यैविध्यम्."), jnanapada's sampled chapter carries no section
# headings at all, and charyapada wraps them in a tab-indented double
# pipe ("|| विलोमनिरूपणम्.||"). One shared rule covers all four without
# needing to know which pada a given page belongs to: a heading line
# never carries a danda/pipe of its own (real verse text always does),
# so any such line that's either asterisk-wrapped, double-pipe-wrapped,
# or simply ends in a bare "." is apparatus, not text. Footnotes across
# all 4 padas use the same bracket/paren apparatus as Jayakhyasamhita's
# critical convention (inline bare-digit markers, footnote text on its
# own parenthesized line) -- reused directly via the same paren/bracket
# fixed-point stripping loop.
#
# jnanapada's sampled chapter was also seen dropping the chapter prefix
# on at least one verse ref ("।। 10 ।।" instead of "।। 1.10 ।।") -- and,
# checked directly, found kriyapada adhyaya 16 wasn't the only place a
# ref's own chapter digit can't be trusted: its own raw wikitext reads
# "।। 116.56 ।।" sitting directly between two verses correctly marked
# "16.55" and "16.57" -- a plain source-side typo (an extra "1"), not a
# real chapter-116-out-of-32. Since the page's own true chapter number
# is already known externally (this function's own `chapter_num`
# parameter, taken from the page title, which every convention agrees is
# reliable), a two-number ref's own captured chapter digit is never used
# at all -- the ref pattern only needs to recognize *where* a ref sits
# and pull out its verse number; `chapter_num` supplies the chapter
# unconditionally, closing this whole class of typo rather than
# hand-fixing the one instance found.
#
# Checked directly at full scale: yogapada/kriyapada's asterisk-wrapped
# headings also turn up in two further variants -- a leading "?" before
# the opening "*" ("?* परवारकल्पनम्.*"), and "?" substituted for the
# closing "*" outright ("* कौतुकायाममानम्?") -- recurring often enough
# (several chapters, several times each) to be a real, if inconsistent,
# transcription habit rather than one-off typos, unlike the isolated
# unbalanced-paren cases elsewhere in the corpus that are left alone.
# "*" and "?" are treated as interchangeable heading delimiters, either
# one allowed at either end, the same way "।" and "|" already are for
# verse-ref brackets elsewhere in this file.
