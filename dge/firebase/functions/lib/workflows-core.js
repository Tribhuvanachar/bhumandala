// each one accepts, and who is allowed to press it.

// Pure functions only: no Firebase, no network, no secrets. index.js is the
// shell that holds the token and makes the call; everything a mistake could
// cost lives here, where `node --test` can reach it (../tests/workflows-core.test.js).

// workflows in this repository, so the question is never "what did the browser
// ask for" but "is that one of the five things this button is for". A caller
// cannot name a workflow file, cannot invent an input, and cannot reach a
// branch other than the one declared here. If a new workflow should be
// clickable, it is added below — deliberately, in a commit — and not before.
