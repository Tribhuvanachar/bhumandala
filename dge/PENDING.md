# DGE — Pending Items, Open Issues, and Possible Improvements

Single running backlog for the DGE project. Anything not fully finished —
a real bug, a feature only partly built, a decision waiting on the
project lead, an idea worth doing later — goes here, not just in a
commit message or a chat reply. Update this file in the same commit as
the work that surfaces or resolves an item; don't let it drift from
`PROJECT_STATUS.md`'s narrative history, which stays a log of what
happened, not a todo list.

Conventions: newest items at the top of each section. Strike through
(`~~like this~~`) rather than delete when something's resolved, and
leave one line noting the resolving commit — that way the file stays a
complete record, not just a live queue.

## Future feature ideas — designed but not yet greenlit

- **Raghavendra Vijaya: English translation OCR-linked + Gemini
  padaccheda/anvaya/summary pipeline — IMPLEMENTED (2026-08-21).** First
  real, non-proof-of-concept run of the "AI automation" this project's lead
  asked to build (see the Gemini-enrichment pipeline item just below this
  one, and the reviewed architecture note it came from). Two independent
  parts:
  1. **OCR + link the published English translation.** A 68 MB, 312-page
     scanned PDF (Huli V. Pavamanacharya's English translation of
     Sri Raghavendra Vijaya, uploaded directly, split 7z archive) was
     extracted (`pdftotext -layout`, poppler-utils) and split into 10
     per-canto page ranges using this corpus's own known verse counts per
     sarga (42/54/58/49/44/76/49/78/62/66 = 578) as ground truth to detect
     page boundaries — cross-checked against the OCR'd running-header text
     (`CANTO-I`..`CANTO-X`), since the ABBYY FineReader OCR layer is too
     garbled (stray mid-word spaces, misread roman numerals) to trust
     alone. Ten parallel reading agents then transcribed+cleaned (OCR
     spacing-artifact removal only, no paraphrasing) each canto's English
     text into exactly N numbered verse entries, flagging any genuinely
     ambiguous verse-boundary split in an `uncertain_boundaries` list rather
     than silently guessing — one canto (2) was initially missed verses 1-9
     (page range started one section too late) and was caught by a hard
     verse-count check, not silently accepted; recovered directly from the
     PDF and re-merged. All 578 verses recovered, 0 fabricated for a
     missing boundary (a few unrecoverable Sanskrit technical terms inside
     the English prose were dropped rather than guessed — logged per-canto).
     `tools/link_english_commentary.py` merges the transcript into each
     `sarga_N/data.json` under `shlokas[n].commentaries.pavamanacharya_english`
     — refuses to merge a canto whose verse count doesn't match
     `metadata.totalShlokas` exactly, so a page-range mistake like the
     canto-2 one above fails loudly instead of silently linking to the
     wrong verse. Sanskrit OCR was deliberately never attempted (per
     instruction) — this corpus already holds the Sanskrit mula text; only
     the English commentary needed extracting.
  2. **Gemini padaccheda/anvaya/summary.** `tools/gemini_summarize.py`
     sends each shloka's Sanskrit text plus (when present) the newly-linked
     English translation to Gemini as context — the RAG principle from the
     reviewed proposal ("don't make Gemini guess blind when DGE already has
     the answer") applied to translation-as-context rather than
     citation-verification, since padaccheda/anvaya are Gemini's own
     linguistic analysis with no local corpus fact to check them against
     (unlike the citation pipeline below, this one has no
     verified/possible/unresolved tier — there is nothing in the corpus to
     verify a word-split against). What keeps it honest instead: results
     land under clearly-labeled `gemini_padaccheda`/`gemini_anvaya`/
     `gemini_summary` keys, each rendered with an explicit
     "AI ..., unreviewed" label (`dge/js/core.js`'s
     `KNOWN_COMMENTARY_LABELS`) — never presented as a vetted commentary.
     `tools/gemini_client.py` was factored out of `tools/gemini_enrich.py`
     (request shape, error classification, one-fallback-attempt retry) so
     this script reuses it rather than duplicating it.
  3. **Bypass flags, as explicitly requested.** Both
     `.github/workflows/gemini-enrich.yml` and the new
     `.github/workflows/gemini-summarize-kavya.yml` gained a `direct_push`
     input: off (default) opens a review PR as before; on, the workflow
     commits and pushes straight to `main`, skipping the PR/review step
     entirely. Built because asked for directly ("there should be an option
     to bypass manual review, bypass proofread, and directly push it to the
     library"); left off by default and used PR review for the English-
     translation linking above (a brand-new content type through a brand-
     new tool, on its very first real run) — the flag exists and works, but
     "available" and "used unreviewed on an untested pipeline's first run"
     are different risk calls, and the safer one was made without being asked.
  4. **OCR proofreading was not bypassed**, despite the option to bypass
     being requested. The raw ABBYY OCR text layer is generally readable
     but has enough character-level noise (mangled mid-word spacing) that
     shipping it unproofread would violate `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`'s "don't
     fabricate"/quality rules in spirit even where not in letter — an AI
     reading pass did the cleanup instead of a human, but a cleanup pass
     happened. Distinct from the manual-review bypass in (3) above, which
     is about whether a *person* reviews the PR before merge, not about
     whether the transcription itself is proofread.
  **Known limitations:** a handful of verses across cantos had translator
  prose that covered multiple Sanskrit stanzas in one continuous paragraph
  with no clean per-verse split (documented per-canto in the merge output);
  in a few of these the same text had to be duplicated across the verses it
  covers rather than invented split points — see canto 9, verses 41-46,
  where six stanzas' worth of one philosophical objection shares one
  translated paragraph. Gemini padaccheda/anvaya has no verification tier
  (see point 2) — a follow-up idea, not built here, would be cross-checking
  Gemini's padaccheda word-list against the Kosha/Dhātu corpus the way the
  citation pipeline cross-checks against granthas.

- **Gemini-enrichment pipeline: local Reference Resolution Engine +
  confidence-tiered footnotes — IMPLEMENTED (2026-08-20).** A Gemini
  architecture proposal was reviewed (external analysis of how to enrich
  the ~3 GB corpus with Gemini without either (a) re-sending everything DGE
  already knows, or (b) trusting Gemini's claimed sources on faith). Its
  central point — *"Do not ask Gemini to rediscover knowledge that DGE
  already possesses"* — matched two things already true of this codebase:
  `dge/convert/mapper.js`'s existing design comment ("Gemini's job stays
  narrow and reliable... assembling the exact schema happens here in code,
  where it can be validated") and `dge/convert/review-classifier.js`'s
  confidence-tiered trust classes (A-E). This item builds the same shape
  for corpus-wide citation/quotation detection, and **supersedes the
  execution-model question in the "Batch Gemini-generated padaccheda" item
  below** (point 3 there) for this class of job — decided as a GitHub
  Action with a `GEMINI_API_KEY` repository secret, not a browser BYOK tool.
  That is a deliberate, explicit exception to this project's usual
  BYOK-only / no-server-side-key rule (`PROJECT_BRIEF.md` §7's guardrail
  against server-side keys) — signed off on specifically for this one-off
  batch job, not a general policy change; nothing else in the app stores or
  uses a key this way.

  **What was built:**
  - `tools/reference_resolution/` — a local-first, network-free resolver.
    Implements the proposal's priority ladder: (1) exact `{target_slug,
    unit_id}` match, reusing the corpus's own existing `references[]`
    convention; (2/3) lexical/fuzzy text search of a quoted span against a
    curated `DEFAULT_SEARCH_SCOPE` (today: all 18 Bhagavad Gita chapters +
    the 3962-sūtra Ashtadhyayi sutrapatha), built in-memory per grantha
    using `dge/search_toolkit_pkg`'s existing phonetic-key/trigram
    machinery; (5) "search DGE using Gemini's proposal" via a
    `source_guess` → title-matched slug hint. Returns
    `verified`/`possible`/`unresolved` with a `resolution_method` and
    `confidence`, never fabricating a source that isn't actually there.
  - `tools/gemini_enrich.py` — the batch job itself. Mirrors
    `dge/js/gemini.js`'s request shape (model + `gemini-flash-lite-latest`
    fallback, same status→error-kind classification) using only the
    standard library (`urllib`), no new dependency. Asks Gemini for a
    narrow thing only — quoted/cited spans in one item's commentary prose —
    then **discards any span that isn't an exact verbatim substring** of
    the input before doing anything else with it (this project's
    "don't fabricate" rule, `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` §6, applied to Gemini's own
    claimed quotation, not just to the source it guesses). Surviving spans
    go through the resolver above and get written back as an additive
    `gemini_enrichment: {generated_at, model, segments, references}` block
    (documented in `dge/data/schemas.json` on the four `sanskrit_text`-
    primary schemas) — original fields untouched, safe to re-run (skips
    already-enriched items unless `--force`). `--dry-run` swaps in a
    deterministic, network-free mock citation-detector for testing.
  - `dge/js/footnote-engine.js` + `dge/css/footnotes.css` — renders
    `segments`/`references` as inline superscript markers + a footnote list
    (verified/possible/unresolved get distinct at-a-glance styling), linking
    to the target via the same `index.html?path=...&jumpVedicId=...`
    convention `dge/js/backlinks.js` already uses. Wired into
    `dge/js/render.js`'s `renderList()`, gated to the Devanagari display
    script (enrichment text is stored verbatim in Devanagari, so other
    scripts fall back to plain highlighted text rather than risk mismatched
    markers — a known scope limit, not yet solved).
  - `dge/js/core.js`: `dgeNormalizeGranthaData`'s flat-items branch now
    falls back to `item.sanskrit_text` for `sa` (it previously only checked
    `samhita_patha`/`sa`, which meant `grantha_mula_text`/`grantha_tika_text`
    content — e.g. every Sarvamoola tika — rendered with **empty main text**
    in this reader; found while wiring footnotes in, fixed since the
    footnote feature is undemonstrable without it). Also passes through
    `item.gemini_enrichment` as `shloka.geminiEnrichment`.
  - `tests/test_reference_resolution.py`, `tests/test_gemini_enrich.py` —
    26 new tests (synthetic corpora + one real-corpus check of the
    proposal's own worked example, "dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre" → Bhagavad
    Gītā 1.1.). All 88 repo tests pass (`./run_tests.sh`).

  **Proof run** (`--dry-run`, mock detector, real resolver, against a copy
  of `dge/data/dvaitavedanta/dasha_prakarana_granthas/vishnu_tattva_vinirnaya/
  tika_jayatirtha/data.json`, Jayatīrtha's ṭīkā on Viṣṇutattvavinirṇaya — 158
  items): found 158 quoted spans across the file; resolved **24 verified**
  (exact/near-exact matches, including real Aṣṭādhyāyī sūtras like
  `कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया` → `2.3.18` and Gītā quotations like `क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि
  मां विद्धि` → BG 13.3, both at correct locations), **5 possible** (lower-
  confidence fuzzy matches worth a human look), **251 unresolved** (mostly
  Vedic/other citations outside today's small curated search scope — an
  honest result, not a failure: nothing was invented for them). This was
  **not** committed into the live corpus file — the mock detector's output
  is for pipeline validation, not production content; the file on disk is
  unchanged by this work. Run it for real via the GitHub Action below.

  **To run for real:** add a `GEMINI_API_KEY` repository secret (Settings →
  Secrets and variables → Actions), then dispatch `.github/workflows/
  gemini-enrich.yml` with a target `data.json` path. It runs the enrichment,
  validates the result (`tools/validate_data.py`), and opens a PR scoped to
  just that one file for review — never merges automatically.

  **Known limitations / follow-ups, not solved here:**
  - `DEFAULT_SEARCH_SCOPE` is small and curated (Gita + Ashtadhyayi
    sutrapatha), not the full ~1.1 GB corpus. Building an in-memory index
    over everything on every run doesn't scale; a corpus-wide version
    should reuse the *prebuilt* static trigram index under
    `dge/search_index/` (today queried only from `dge/js/dge-search.js` —
    see `SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md`) instead of re-indexing from scratch in
    Python. Expanding the scope in the meantime is just adding slugs to the
    tuple in `tools/reference_resolution/__init__.py`.
  - Padaccheda/anvaya generation (the *other* batch-Gemini idea, below) is
    a separate scope this item does not cover.
  - Footnotes only render on the Devanagari display script (see above).
  - The dry-run mock detector's "must contain a space" heuristic (to avoid
    treating this commentary style's single-word term-glosses in quotes as
    citations) is a crude stand-in for real Gemini judgment — expected to
    need no equivalent once real Gemini calls are wired in, but worth
    re-checking against real output rather than assuming.

- **"Intelligence" mode — an opt-in, per-source-toggleable reading overlay
  that auto-detects cross-references live in the text being read, marks
  them with a subtle blinking underline, and shows the reference(s) on
  hover (tap on mobile) in a popup (minimize/maximize/close/copy/share) —
  same UI shell as Ask Acharya, but backed by DGE's own precomputed
  cross-references instead of a live Gemini call.** (Refines and replaces
  the earlier "DGE Interlink" note below with the fuller spec given in a
  follow-up message — kept the investigation, expanded the design.)
  **UX spec as described:** a top-level "Intelligence" toggle, off by
  default; once on, the end user activates individual source toggles
  (Ashtadhyayi Sūtras, Dhātus, Kosha, "Dasara Pada" — *unconfirmed
  transcription, possibly ದಾಸರ ಪದ / Haridāsa devotional compositions
  given the project's Madhva/Sarvamoola context, needs confirming, not
  guessed into code*, Sarvamoola, presumably more sources over time).
  Whatever combination is active, every open page (grantha verses,
  commentaries, Kosha entries alike) gets scanned for matches against
  only the active sources; matched words/phrases get a blinking-underline
  span; hovering (or tapping) shows the matched reference(s) with a link.
  Two concrete examples given, and they are two genuinely different
  detection mechanisms, not one:
  1. **Word/headword matching** (Kosha, Dhātus, presumably Sarvamoola) —
     a displayed word IS a known headword/dhātu; tokenize the rendered
     text, SLP1-fold each token (same technique `kosha.js` already uses
     for search), look it up against the relevant index, mark exact hits.
     Cheap and low-risk (few false positives) since it's exact lookup
     against a known set, not pattern inference.
  2. **Citation detection in running prose** (Sūtras) — a commentator's
     own words *reference* a sūtra, either by explicit number ("१.४.१",
     or spelled out "adhyāya 1 pāda 4 sūtra 1") or, harder, by naming/
     quoting the sūtra itself (e.g. citing "वृद्धिरादैच्" rather than its
     number). Numeric-citation detection is a regex problem against known
     adhyāya.pāda.sūtra patterns, feasible now since (per the investigation
     below) every sūtra already has that exact ID in
     `data/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/sutrapatha/data.json`. Name/quote-citation
     detection is substring/fuzzy matching of commentary text against the
     3962 sūtras' own `sanskrit_text`, which is real but meaningfully
     harder and needs real precision tuning — a wrong auto-link in the
     middle of someone's commentary is worse than no link, so this piece
     specifically should ship conservative (exact/near-exact matches only)
     rather than aggressive.
  **Performance note (my own addition, not yet discussed with the project
  lead):** doing (1) and (2) as a live, in-browser, full-corpus scan on
  every page render will not scale once Kosha (1.65M headwords) and the
  full sūtra/commentary corpus are all in scope — likely needs the
  per-text annotation computed *once*, offline/at data-build time, and
  shipped as a small per-grantha index (which spans get which links),
  with the live browser doing cheap index lookups rather than corpus-wide
  matching on every view. Worth confirming before committing to an
  architecture.
  Investigated before any of the above was written (grounded, not
  speculative):
  - Ashtadhyayi sūtras already carry a clean, stable, addressable ID
    (`"id": "1.2.27"`, standard adhyāya.pāda.sūtra form, 3962 sūtras) —
    deep-linking straight TO a specific sūtra is feasible today, but
    nothing exposes it yet: `ashtadhyayi.html` has no hash/query-based
    "jump to sūtra by ID" at all. Small, real, immediately useful on its
    own (shareable direct links to one sūtra), and it's the landing side
    of every link this feature would ever produce — natural Stage 1.
  - Kosha entries carry etymology as **unstructured prose**
    (`sense.etymology`, rendered under "व्युत्पत्तिः:" in `kosha.js`'s
    `openEntry()`), not a structured `{sutra_id: ...}` field, which is
    exactly why word->sūtra needs either citation-parsing or (for the
    general case, not just cited-in-etymology cases) a real Pāṇinian
    generative-grammar derivation engine — essentially what ashtadhyayi.com
    itself runs. Existing open-source engines (e.g. the
    sanskrit-coders/sanskrit_parser ecosystem) are worth evaluating to
    wrap rather than building one from scratch.
  **Proposed staged plan, not started:** Stage 1 — sūtra deep-link target.
  Stage 2 — the reusable hover/tap popup component (minimize/maximize/
  close/copy/share, likely sharing code with Ask Acharya's shell) plus
  word/headword-match detection (mechanism 1 above) for Kosha and Dhātus,
  the cheap and low-risk half. Stage 3 — numeric sūtra-citation detection
  in commentary prose (mechanism 2, numeric case). Stage 4 — named/quoted
  sūtra-citation detection (mechanism 2, hard case) and/or a real
  derivation engine, scoped separately once Stages 1-3 prove the UI is
  worth it. Not started — explicitly asked twice now to design and log
  this, not build it, until told to proceed.

- **Batch Gemini-generated padaccheda ("word split") for every library
  text that doesn't have one yet, rate-limited so it doesn't hit API
  limits.** Once library content fills out further, run this as a batch
  job over whatever granthas are missing padaccheda, using the project's
  existing BYOK Gemini pattern (same `user_gemini_key`/model localStorage
  keys already used by Ask Acharya, the Kosha translate pivot, and the
  Convert tool). Needs, not yet designed in detail: (1) a scan step to
  find which granthas/verses actually lack padaccheda already (don't
  regenerate what exists); (2) a batched runner with real rate-limiting/
  backoff — this project already has that exact pattern built twice
  (Convert tool's OCR-page and Proofread-chunk auto-retry-with-backoff;
  VedaVaNi's extraction script's retry/backoff) so it's a known shape, not
  a new problem; (3) a decision on where this runs — a browser admin tool
  where the project lead pastes their own key and reviews output before
  pushing (matches Convert/Audio Admin's existing self-service pattern)
  vs. a GitHub Action (matches VedaVaNi's scheduled/dispatched pattern) —
  each has tradeoffs (browser tool = easier human review before commit,
  more manual; Action = scales unattended, harder to eyeball each result
  before it lands). Padaccheda generation itself: not started — noted for
  future discussion. **The execution-model question in point (3) is now
  decided *for the reference/citation-enrichment job above* (GitHub Action
  + repo secret, not browser BYOK)** — see the "Gemini-enrichment pipeline"
  item just above this one. Whether padaccheda generation should reuse that
  same Action-based shape or go the browser-tool route instead is still
  open; nothing about padaccheda generation itself has been built.

## Awaiting a decision or action from the project lead

- **Eight `rigveda_ref` values in the Sāmaveda data name the wrong verse** (found
  18 Aug while propagating Sāyaṇa; `tools/sayana_smriti/SOURCES.md` §7 has the
  evidence). These are errors in DGE's own Sāmaveda data, not in the
  propagation. `propagate_samaveda.py` now checks each ref against the mantra
  text and **skips** these eight rather than repairing them silently, so the
  commentary is absent rather than wrong — but the refs themselves still want
  fixing at source, which is a content call:
  | agreement | SV → RV | |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0.11 | 1429 → 9.89.5 | no word in common |
  | 0.19 | 385 → 4.39.6 | no word in common |
  | 0.22 | 1420 → 1.93.3 | no word in common |
  | 0.23 | 469 → 9.65.1 | no word in common |
  | 0.26 | 345 → 8.24.16 | no word in common |
  | 0.40 | 891 → 9.61.17 | **890 and 891 appear to name each other's verses** |
  | 0.52 | 890 → 9.61.18 | |
  | 0.53 | 1204 → 9.12.8 | |
  Eight more agree only partially (0.55–0.70) where the Sāmaveda's own reading or
  verse division differs; those *are* propagated, since every entry already tells
  the reader it is Sāyaṇa on the parallel Ṛgveda mantra.
- **150 dangling `library.json` entries, all dvaitavedanta.** Pre-existing on
  main, not caused by the Sāyaṇa work, and unchanged by it.
  `tools/audit_library.py --fix` clears them in one command. Left alone across
  three sessions now because they may belong to an in-flight crawl — **this needs
  a yes or no from the project lead**, otherwise it will keep being deferred.
- **Rights on the archive.org Sāyaṇa scan** (`rgveda-with-sayanabhasya`) — the
  item states no licence. Sāyaṇa's text is long out of copyright; the Vaidika
  Saṃśodhana Maṇḍala edition's own status is unchecked. Now lower priority: the
  Wikisource route (CC BY-SA, stated) supplies 98.45% and is what actually
  shipped, so this only matters if the OCR route is ever published from.
- **New content acquisition — Chandas, Nirukta, Śikṣā/Prātiśākhya, Ayurveda, Kāmaśāstra and Nītiśāstra, each work zeroed in on ONE verified source (18 Aug 2026).** A wide sweep of candidate sites (Ambuda, GRETIL, Sanskrit Documents, SARIT, NIIMH/CCRAS, TITUS, Cologne Lexicon, wisdomlib, subhashita.com, DSBC) was proposed for these categories. Rather than storing that as a shopping list, every candidate site and specific text below was actually fetched and read before being written down here — this project has already been burned twice by declaring GRETIL filenames that turned out not to exist (see `works.json`'s Naiṣadhīyacarita/Mṛcchakaṭika/Kāvyaprakāśa entries above), so "checked" below means a real HTTP 200 and an inspected passage, not a guessed URL pattern. **One correction to the original brief first: Alaṅkāraśāstra (Kāvyādarśa, Kāvyālaṅkāra, Dhvanyāloka, Vakroktijīvita, Kāvyaprakāśa, Daśarūpaka, Sāhityadarpaṇa, Rasagaṅgādhara, Śṛṅgāraprakāśa, Chandomañjarī, Nāṭyaśāstra) is not a gap — every one of those titles is already registered in `tools/kavya/config/works.json` with its source checked the same day this note was written, several already correctly marked "no machine-readable source" rather than left unverified. Nothing below duplicates that.**

  **Reachability, checked directly by curl from this sandbox, not assumed:** `ambuda.org`, `gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de`, `sanskritdocuments.org`, `titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de`, `sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de`, `wisdomlib.org` (root only — see Ayurveda caveat below), `subhashita.com` and `dsbcproject.org` are all reachable (HTTP 200). **`sarit.indology.info` times out (curl exit 28) and `niimh.nic.in` fails TLS outright on every path (curl exit 35, no HTTP response at all)** — not a 403/407 policy block (the proxy's own status endpoint shows no relay failure recorded), a genuine connection-level failure, the same class this project has already met with wisdomlib/sacred-texts/madhwakart et al.: reachable from GitHub Actions or a residential/phone connection, not from here. So neither SARIT nor NIIMH — the two sources the original brief was most enthusiastic about — could be used directly; every recommendation below is a real alternative that **is** reachable now.

  **Chandas** (`vedanga/chandas`, currently empty) — Piṅgala's own Chandaḥsūtra and Hemacandra's Chandonuśāsana are dead ends: not on GRETIL (checked the full catalogue), and the one HTML mirror sanskritdocuments points to for Piṅgala now sits behind a JS bot-wall with no Wayback fallback reachable from here. "Gaṇaratnamahodadhi" and "Kavikaṇṭhābharaṇa Chandas" in the original brief both look like misattributions — the first is a Pāṇinian gaṇapāṭha work, the second is Nānyadeva's Bharata-bhāṣya (music/dance), neither is actually a Chandas treatise, and neither exists machine-readably regardless.

    TITUS holds a Nirukta transcription but gated to registered members — not usable as "reachable." Not found anywhere machine-readable and open: nothing beyond the two OCR items above.

  **Śikṣā + Prātiśākhya** (`vedanga/shiksha` / `vedanga/shiksha/pratishakhya` — the taxonomy already names 29 specific empty leaf nodes for these; none renamed or added here, only sourced). GRETIL turned out to have **nothing** in this area at all despite being the default first guess — its "Pratiśākhyas" heading under Vedāṅga contains only the Nirukta and Ṛgvidhāna. The single biggest find: one archive.org anthology, **Śikṣāsaṃgraha** (ed. Rāmaprasād Tripāṭhī, Sampūrṇānanda Sanskrit University, 1989, `archive.org/details/shikshasamgraha`, PDF scan + OCR text, licence unstated), supplies real verified text for **24 of the 29 named nodes in one file** — its actual table of contents (with page ranges) was read to confirm each item rather than trusting the title alone:

    Pāṇinīya, Svarāṅkuśa, Ṣoḍaśaślokī (Ṛgveda); Yājñavalkya, Vāsiṣṭhī, Kātyāyanī, Pārāśarī, Māṇḍavya, Amoghānandinī, Laghu-Amoghānandinī, Mādhyandinī, Varṇaratnapradīpikā, Keśavī, Hastasvaraprakriyā, Avasānanirṇaya, Svarabhaktilakṣaṇapariśiṣṭa, Kramasandhāna, Manaḥsvara, Yajurvidhāna, Svarāṣṭaka, Kramakārikā (Yajurveda); Gautamī, Lomaśī, Nāradīya (Sāmaveda); Māṇḍūkī (Atharvaveda).

    Dead ends, checked and confirmed absent everywhere machine-readable: Kokkoka's *Ratirahasya* (Koka Śāstra — only an English translation OCR exists), Ānaṅgaraṅga, Śukranīti. `subhashita.com`'s homepage is a bare JS-SPA shell with no server-rendered text — not usable as a scrape source despite being reachable.

  **Decisions needed, not made here:** (1) new top-level taxonomy placement for Ayurveda and Kāmaśāstra — traditionally Upavedas, alongside Nītiśāstra which has no obvious home (`kavya_alankara` already holds the śatakas, but Cāṇakya/Kāmandakīya/Hitopadeśa/Pañcatantra sit oddly there too); (2) whether GRETIL's blanket CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (the single largest source across every category above) clears the same non-commercial bar the project already treats sanskritsahitya-com's unlicensed grant as clearing, or needs its own explicit note per the `LICENSING.md` pattern.

  **~~(3) whether the `hrishikeshrt/chanda` structured-metre CSVs are worth ingesting despite their AGPL-3.0 licence~~ — approved by the project lead (case-by-case) and done, same day.** `dge/data/vedanga/chandas/data.json` now holds the full 282-entry vrutta database (190 sama, 8 ardhasama, 5 vishama, 42 upajāti, 10 mātrā-vṛtta, 27 akṣara-jāti names), built by `tools/chandas/build_vrutta_db.py` from a pinned vendor copy (`tools/chandas/vendor/`, commit `3a9607c`) — the first AGPL-3.0 content this project carries, clearly marked as such (`vendor/NOTICE.md`, SPDX headers on both new `.py` files, everything else in the repo stays Apache-2.0). `tools/chandas/identify_vrutta.py` wraps the upstream `chanda` PyPI package for actual metre identification, not just lookup, and was verified against real verses, not assumed: the Gītā's opening pada (धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे...) correctly identifies as अनुष्टुभ्, a Bhartṛhari verse correctly identifies as शार्दूलविक्रीडित. This is classical (laukika) vṛtta only — it does not resolve the earlier, harder, still-open Vedic-chandas problem in `05_chandas_autodetect_FAILED.py`, which is a different kind of metre entirely. **Not done:** batch-tagging the ~67,000-entry Kāvya corpus with detected metre per śloka — a natural next use of this tool, scoped separately since that corpus lives on a different branch/CDN than `main`.

  **Follow-up, 20 Aug: a clean-room Apache-2.0 alternative now exists alongside the AGPL vendor copy, at `tools/chandas_native/`.** Same idea — gaṇa-based scansion + a named-metre database — but derived from scratch from the standard gaṇa system (public domain, centuries older than any software), not from `hrishikeshrt/chanda`'s CSVs or code. Deliberately smaller, not padded to match: 13 sama-vṛtta (the ones that actually recur through classical kāvya, not the full 190), a rule-based Anuṣṭubh handler, 16 mechanically-generated Indravajrā/Upendravajrā upajāti combinations (vs. 42 individually-named ones), 2 mātrā-vṛtta, akṣara-jāti names 1-20. No ardhasama/vishama vṛtta yet — those need primary-source checking, not recall. All 13 sama-vṛtta lakṣaṇa strings were cross-checked against the AGPL vendor's own values as a pure QA step and matched exactly (expected, since these are old public facts derived independently via the gaṇa table, not copied from the vendor CSVs) — `yati` was dropped instead of guessed, since the vendor's segment-length convention didn't reproduce reliably from recall. `tools/chandas_native/verify.py` checks 3 real, independently-recalled verses (Gita 1.1, two Bhartṛhari verses) against their known metres, all passing. **Decision needed, not made here:** whether/when to retire the AGPL vendor copy in favour of this one — right now that would be a coverage regression (13 vs. 190 sama-vṛtta), so both directories coexist; extending the native one further means checking new entries against a real primary source the way these 13 were checked, one at a time, not transcribing more of the vendor's data.

  **Follow-up, 21 Aug: a scholarly review of a Gemini-assisted extension pass, fact-checked and mostly incorporated.** A prompt asking Gemini to extend `tools/chandas_native/` from primary sources (Vṛttaratnākara, Chandomañjarī) was drafted and run; the project lead then independently checked Gemini's output against accessible editions/tables before anything touched the database — the same posture this tool has taken throughout, applied to a third party's output instead of Claude's own. That review found: 8 new sama-vṛtta (शालिनी, रथोद्धता, स्वागता, भुजङ्गप्रयात, स्रग्विणी, प्रहर्षिणी, रुचिरा, हरिणी) and 3 ardhasama-vṛtta (पुष्पिताग्रा, वियोगिनी/सुन्दरी, अपरवक्त्र) with correct gaṇa formulas; 2 more mātrā-vṛtta (उपगीति, उद्गीति); a caveat that Vaitālīya/Aupacchandasika need structural fields beyond a matra-per-pada count, not attempted; a caveat that akṣara-jāti 21-26 names, while plausible, need edition-specific citation rather than being treated as fixed — and, as the headline finding, that **Gemini's 14 named upajāti combinations (Siddhi/Prabhā/Mandā/Kāntā/Kāmā/Saubhāgyā/Pūrṇā/Bhadrā/Jayā and others) do not match the standard Vṛttaratnākara nomenclature**, which the review gave as Kīrti/Vāṇī/Mālā/Śālā/Haṃsī/Māyā/Chāyā/Bālā/Ārdrā/Bhadrā/Premā/Rāmā/Ṛddhi/Buddhi instead.

  Before merging any of this, Claude re-verified independently rather than taking either party's word: (1) recomputed all 11 new gaṇa-formula entries' syllable/guru/laghu/mātrā counts from `build_db.py`'s own gaṇa table — all matched the review's stated numbers exactly, with one minor catch of its own (the review's prose for Bhujaṅgaprayāta said "8 laghus, 4 gurus," which is backwards — the correct 4 laghu / 8 guru split is what its own stated 20-mātrā total actually requires, and is what got recorded); (2) searched independently for the Upajāti naming and found a *third*, independently-scholarly-looking source (ancient-buddhist-texts.net's Upajāti Varieties table, explicitly citing VR) that **also disagreed with the reviewer's own supplied table** — e.g. reviewer said Kīrti = इन्द्रवज्रा-उपेन्द्रवज्रा-उपेन्द्रवज्रा-उपेन्द्रवज्रा, the third source said the exact complement, उपेन्द्रवज्रा-इन्द्रवज्रा-इन्द्रवज्रा-इन्द्रवज्रा. Rather than trust either on authority, Claude fetched that third source's raw laghu/guru prosodic symbols (⏑/−) verbatim for 4 of the 14 names (Kīrti, Vāṇī, Ārdrā, Buddhi) and decoded them by hand against this file's own gaṇa table — all 4 matched the third source's table exactly, unambiguously, at the level of individual syllable weights, not just a name label. The reviewer's table was therefore **not** used; the third source's full 14-name table was adopted instead (4/14 individually symbol-verified, the other 10 taken from the same page on the strength of that agreement — see `build_db.py`, the `NAMED_UPAJATI` comment, for the full account and citation). Akṣara-jāti 21-26 got the same independent-search treatment and came out worse, not better: a third search turned up a *fourth* mapping that was internally inconsistent with itself (assigned syllable-count 22 to two different names, skipped 21 and 24) — so 21-26 stayed out entirely rather than picking a source to trust.

  Net result: `tools/chandas_native/data.json` grew from 13 to 21 sama-vṛtta, gained an ardhasama-vṛtta category (3 entries), gained 2 mātrā-vṛtta, and the upajāti mixed forms now carry sourced traditional names instead of pattern-only labels — all still smaller than the AGPL vendor's 282-entry catalogue, still not padded to match it, and every new entry has a stated verification method. This is also a concrete demonstration of why "check it against a primary source" was the right bar to set: three different attempts at the same specific fact (Upajāti naming, then akṣara-jāti 21-26) produced three-to-four *different* answers before one was actually nailed down at the symbol level — confident-looking citations kept disagreeing with each other, not just with unverified recall.

- **~~The published site is 1,091 MB against GitHub Pages' 1 GB limit~~ — down to 999 MB, and every decision below is the project lead's, taken 18 Aug.** Under the limit, but by 1%, so the next few granthas put it back over. What was done:
  - **Archives deleted (74.5 MB)** — `mahabharata.7z.001/.002`, `smv-assets-audio.7z.001/.002/.003`, `smv-assets-text*.zip`. All in git history. `vedavani-assets.zip` stays: `vedavani-extract.yml` unzips it at CI time.
  - **`dge/data/kosha` kept (61 MB), by decision** — the site reads the full corpus from `bhumandala-kosha-data`, so what stays in-repo is now a fallback for when that CDN is unreachable rather than dead weight. Worth remembering when the next CDN failure is diagnosed.
  - **`dge/convert/backups` kept (14 MB)** — not covered by the decision, so not touched.
  - **Audio moved to `Tribhuvanachar/bhumandala-audio-data` (29 MB)** — 1,041 Sumadhva Vijaya files under `smv_audio/`, served over jsDelivr, foldered by Internet Archive item identifier so the eventual move to archive.org is a host-prefix change in `config.js` and no data edit. The repo already existed and was empty.
  - **Step B — the generated indexes and `prakriya` — deferred**, by decision. The list and the numbers are in this file's history (commit `98bc8be`) when it is wanted: `search_index/postings` 168.7 MB, `search_index/units` 116.4 MB, `prakriya` 66.9 MB, `_morph` 14.8 MB, `_synonyms` 3.6 MB, ~370 MB in all. The search-index slimming below shrinks the two largest of those rather than relocating them, and is the better next move.

- **~~The Sanskrit WordNet is built and wired in, and its 24 MB has nowhere to live~~ — resolved 18 Aug: it lives on this repo's own `wordnet-dist` branch and the reader loads it over jsDelivr.** `tools/build_wordnet.py` turns IndoWordNet's Sanskrit half into 37,734 synsets / 80,009 words / 589 buckets / 23.8 MB, and `js/intellisense.js` shows it as the अर्थः section of the word popover. What was decided, and why:
  - **A branch of this repo, not a new repository.** A dedicated `bhumandala-wordnet-data` was the first choice — the koshas' pattern exactly — and creating it failed: the GitHub App cannot create repositories, which is the same block that made the project lead create `bhumandala-kosha-data` by hand in Round 4. A branch turned out to be the better answer anyway at this size. **GitHub Pages publishes `main` and nothing else**, so `wordnet-dist` is invisible to the site and costs it nothing, while jsDelivr serves any branch: `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Tribhuvanachar/bhumandala@wordnet-dist/_wordnet`. The site stays at about 991 MB; the branch adds ~10 MB packed to the repository, which is a different budget. The koshas needed their own repository at ~1.8 GB — this is a twentieth of that.
  - **`appConfig.wordnetDataBase` in `js/config.js` is the one place to repoint it**, so moving to a dedicated repo later is a URL change and nothing else. `intellisense.js` carries the same URL as its own default because the four Vyakarana pages never load `config.js`.
  - **`.github/workflows/publish-wordnet.yml` rebuilds and republishes it** (manual run, dry-run by default). It force-pushes: the branch is a publication, not a log, and keeping superseded 24 MB trees in its history would cost repository size for nothing.
  - **Verified**, since a CDN is easy to believe and hard to check: the manifest and buckets are live on jsDelivr with `access-control-allow-origin: *`; the popover was driven in a real headless browser against those published bytes and rendered मोक्षः with both senses. This sandbox's browser has no route out to the CDN — a sandbox limit, not a production one, the same one the Round 4 kosha cutover hit — so the published files were fetched with curl and re-served locally over CORS for that test, leaving only the transport substituted. **A spot-check on the live site once this deploys is still worth doing.**

- **Two open questions about the WordNet data itself, both for the project lead rather than for code.**
  - **Licence.** The dump is the one distributed with `pyiwn` (CFILT, IIT Bombay), whose repository carries CC BY-SA 4.0; IndoWordNet's own pages frame the data as for research use. The attribution CC BY-SA asks for is in the manifest and on screen in the popover heading. Whether those two statements agree is the same kind of question the koshas' `LICENSING.md` already leaves open, and it is answered the same way — recorded, not decided here.
  - **The Kannada column is the Kannada WordNet's own words for a synset, not a translation of the Sanskrit one, and the two occasionally disagree.** Synset 117 is भक्तिः "ईश्वरं प्रति अनुरागः" in Sanskrit and ಭಕ್ತ — the devotee, not the devotion — in Kannada. Spot checks put it in a small minority (जल/ನೀರು, मोक्षः/ಮೋಕ್ಷ, गुरुः/ಗುರು, ज्ञानम्/ಜ್ಞಾನ all line up), and nothing in the data marks the bad rows, so a script cannot filter them. `--languages ""` drops the column outright if that trade is not wanted.

- **Every external source in one registry, and a fortnightly check that reports what moved — `dge/SOURCE_SYNC.md`.** `admin/config/sources.registry.json` names **17 sources**: the 13 the corpus was imported from (GRETIL, sanskritsahitya, Ambuda, sa.wikisource, dvaitavedanta.in, madhwafestivals, dasasahitya.net, meerasubbarao, SanskritDocuments, IndoWordNet, the indic-dict StarDict mirrors, the UT Austin Sāyaṇa hub, archive.org) and 4 that were read or evaluated but never ingested, so that "where did this come from, and did anyone check it?" has an answer for every site the project has touched. It is an **index, not a copy** — each importer family keeps its own detailed registry and the entry points at it, because two copies of a source list drift and a registry that lies is worse than none. `.github/workflows/check-sources.yml` runs on the 1st and the 16th (and on a click), fingerprints each source, opens an **issue** when something moved, and commits the new fingerprints so the next run reports the next change rather than the same one forever. **It imports nothing, by design**: an import rewrites granthas, and this project's own near-miss — a merge that would have appended a second Raghuvaṃśa rather than updating it — is the argument against ever letting an unattended job do that. Eleven of the seventeen have a working automatic probe; the other five say so rather than reporting "no change" from a check that never ran.
  - **Next, in order:** an archive.org probe (its metadata endpoint gives a real `item_last_updated`); reporting *what* changed rather than *that* it changed (the html_index probe already holds the list — it needs to diff rather than hash); a one-work import path (`--works <id>` exists but no workflow input exposes it).
- **The buttons inside the site — `admin/workflows.html`, built; the Function it wants is not deployed.** The page lists the five clickable workflows, colours them by whether they rewrite text a reader will see, shows each one's last run in IST, and — where the Cloud Function is reachable — starts the job without leaving the site. **Today it is in its fallback form**, because `AUTH_CONFIG.enabled` is still false on this deployment: every button opens the GitHub Actions page instead, and the banner at the top says so rather than looking identical to the live version. The server side is written and tested (`dge/firebase/functions/lib/workflows-core.js`, 30 tests; `listWorkflows` and `runWorkflow` in `index.js`): only the five workflows in `functions/workflows.json`, only their declared inputs, only from `main` — never a caller-supplied ref — only for a caller whose **Firestore** role is high enough (`superadmin` to republish corpus text, `admin` for the reporting jobs), one press a minute per account, every press recorded in `workflow_dispatches`.
  - **Blocked on two things only the project lead can create,** both in `dge/FIREBASE_SETUP.md` §12: the **Blaze** plan (a Function on the free plan cannot reach `api.github.com` at all) and a **fine-grained** token — this repository only, Actions read-and-write only, nothing else. A classic PAT with `repo` scope sitting in a service that accepts browser requests is how a project loses its repository.
  - **The admin-panel button needs one server-side hop and is not free.** The site is static on Pages, so a page cannot start a job and must never hold a token that could. `dge/firebase/functions/` already exists and already does this class of thing, so it is ~30 lines plus a **fine-grained, this-repository-only, Actions-write-only** token in Firebase config — and outbound calls from a Function need the **Blaze** plan. Until then the GitHub Actions "Run workflow" button is the same capability with no new secret to protect.

- **The kāvya tracker has a button now** — `.github/workflows/kavya-tracker.yml`, run from Actions, and automatically after a Kāvya import republishes the corpus. No one needs to run a `.py` file.

- **A search that costs 16 MB a query, and what to do about it — `dge/SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.** Asked whether each section should have its own index, the measurement said the section question is not the urgent one. **A single query downloads 5 to 40 MB**: राम is 16.1 MB, तपःस्वाध्यायनिरतं is 40.4 MB, because a trigram is filed by its first TWO characters, so `na` — the commonest sequence in Sanskrit — is one 7.0 MB file that almost every query touches. Splitting by section does not help the global search, which is the one a reader uses. **One file per trigram plus a document-frequency table, and fetching only the two or three rarest trigrams of a query, takes 40.4 MB to 241 KB — about 150×**, measured against the live index, and touches only `build_search_index.py` and `dge-search.js`. The document also recommends **one index partitioned by section rather than per-section indexes plus a global one** (a separate global index duplicates every posting; scope is already a filter, since the manifest carries a category per grantha and a posting is `[granthaIdx, unitIdx]`), and **against a repository per section** — a branch does everything a repository does here, and the GitHub App cannot create repositories, which blocked this twice already. Nothing is built yet; it is a decision document with the numbers in it.

- **A kāvya tracker — `dge/KAVYA_TRACKER.md`, generated by `tools/build_kavya_tracker.py`.** It reads what is published from `dge/data`, what the Kāvya corpus holds, what `works.json` was asked for, and a curated list of the Mādhva-lineage kāvyas the project lead named, and reports: **69 works tracked, 70,041 verses held, 6 complete (8.7%), 39 mūla with the commentary still missing, 14 with no usable source, 10 named and nothing yet.** The distinction it exists to make is Raghavendra Vijaya's: ten sargas of mūla published, every shloka carrying an empty `commentaries` block — finished by verse count, half done by what a reader needs. The Vijaya kāvyas the project lead listed are in `tools/kavya/config/tracker_wanted.json` with the dictated form kept beside the reading, and **one is unresolved: "kushaharana"**, which this session could not match to any title and has deliberately not guessed into Devanagari.

- **~~26 of the 58 kāvya works have no machine-readable source~~ — nineteen of them now do, from Ambuda and Wikisource; fourteen remain.** The corpus is **43 works / 68 layers / 94,949 entries**, up from 24 / 49 / 66,977.
  - **ambuda.org (tier C), six works.** Ambuda publishes its whole library as one 7.7 MB TEI export rather than a file per text, so the importer fetches that once and reads members out of it. Its text is proofed and structured, and it is the only source for **Ūrubhaṅga**, and for **Bhartṛhari's three śatakas** — `shatakatrayam.xml` holds all three as sections 1, 2 and 3, which is what unblocks the works GRETIL could only offer as one undivided file. Also Amaruśataka and Bhāsa's Dūtavākya.
  - **sa.wikisource.org (tier D), thirteen works** — including the plays GRETIL does not carry at all: Mṛcchakaṭika, Mudrārākṣasa, Mālavikāgnimitra, Uttararāmacarita, Cārudatta, Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa, Madhyamavyāyoga; and Naiṣadhīyacarita (8,974 units), Jānakīharaṇa (5,344 — the register had it as *scan only*), Kādambarī, Harṣacarita, Kāvyaprakāśa, Chandomañjarī.
  - **Three things the tier-D path needed.** Half these works are ProofreadPage transclusions whose wikitext is a header and one `<pages index=.../>` line, with the 60,000 words in the Page: namespace behind it — so it reads the RENDERED html, not the wikitext. Wikisource closes a verse with `।। ६ ।।`, one bare number, where the shared GRETIL matcher demands two components; the parser's own single-number branch could never fire. And a Sanskrit play is prose with verses set into it, so every block is kept in document order — a numbered verse is `<act>.<n>`, the prose after it `<act>.<n>.<k>`, three numeric parts so it sorts between verse n and n+1.
  - **A script filter, because these editions carry their apparatus inline.** Kādambarī arrived with 193 blocks of English introduction, editor's name and corrigenda; a block whose letters are mostly not Devanagari is not part of a Devanagari corpus. Prakrit in the dramas is unaffected.
  - **Two known impurities, recorded in `works.json` rather than hidden:** the Wikisource editions of **Mudrārākṣasa (~4% of units)** and **Mṛcchakaṭika (~1%)** print a ṭīkā in the same flow as the mūla, so those units carry commentary mixed into the verse.
  - **Fourteen still have nothing usable.** Five are scan-only or have no digital text at all (Haravijaya, Yādavābhyudaya, Nalacampū, Yaśastilaka, Ānandavṛndāvanacampū). Four are on neither site (Mālatīmādhava, Mahāvīracarita, Prabodhacandrodaya, Haṃsasandeśa). Five are on Wikisource in a state not worth publishing, each with its reason in `works.json`: Vikramāṅkadevacarita (raw djvu with the English introduction and errata inline), Rasagaṅgādhara and Śṛṅgāraprakāśa (unsegmented — 680,000 characters in 72 units), Vikramorvaśīya and Anargharāghava (a single act, or 19 verses of a five-act play).

- **~~Corpus search could never find a verse in a shloka-based grantha~~ — reindexed, and the index moved off the site.** The run rebuilt it with the `extract_text` fix and the result was **916 granthas / 94,664 units** where the committed index had the Vedas and little else. It also weighed **330 MB** and took the published site from 966 MB to **1,013 MB**, past the ceiling this file spent Round 5 getting under — so the index is now on a `search-dist` branch, read over jsDelivr from `appConfig.searchIndexBase`, and **the site is back to about 685 MB**, its most headroom since the corpus started growing. `window.DGE_SEARCH_INDEX` was already the override the client looked for; `global-search.js` carries the same URL as its default for pages that do not load `config.js`. `search_index/backlinks/` stays on main at 0.1 MB. Verified in a real browser against the published index: वागर्थाविव finds Raghuvaṃśa, तपःस्वाध्यायनिरतं finds the Rāmāyaṇa's opening, मोक्षः finds the Anuvyākhyāna, Śānti Parva, Viṣṇutattvanirṇaya and the Nyāyāmṛta. **Item 6 of the six phone-reported faults — "the magnifying glass returns no library results" — was almost certainly this**, and is worth re-checking on the phone now rather than investigated further.

- **The reader pins a commit, not a branch, and a republish now has a second step.** jsDelivr caches a `@branch` URL for **12 hours** at the edge. The first Kāvya republish proved what that costs: the corrected corpus was live at origin within seconds and readers stayed on the superseded build — the one with GRETIL's romanised variant verses in it — with nothing on either side to say so, and an explicit purge of all 50 files did not shift it within the time I watched. `appConfig.kavyaDataBase`, `appConfig.wordnetDataBase`, `js/kavya.js` and `js/intellisense.js` therefore name a commit hash, which jsDelivr treats as immutable and serves immediately. The cost is that **republishing is now two steps** — publish, then bump the hash — and both workflows print the exact line to paste into their job summary. Worth revisiting if a rebuild ever becomes frequent enough for that to chafe.

- **The four kāvyas that exist twice — resolved as far as code can take it; the last step is an editorial call.** `merge.py` now carries the id bridge: `unit_key()` reads `sarga_01`, `01` and `1` as one chapter, `_index()` registers every shloka under both its `id` and its reconstructed `<chapter>.<number>`, and `_sort()` orders a bridged layer correctly rather than filing the pre-existing verses under a blank key and putting the new arrivals above them. Proved on the live file, not just in tests: merging the branch's Raghuvaṃśa mūla into `dge/data`'s **leaves 19 sargas as 19** where the naive merge made 38, keeps `default_author`, and adds 73 verses. Four tests pin it by name. **What is left is not mechanical:** the same merge reports **1,463 conflicts**, because the two copies are the same text in different orthography — main writes संपृक्तौ where tier A writes सम्पृक्तौ — and the rule is that the repo copy wins a disagreement. So nothing was merged into `dge/data`. The question for the project lead is which orthography is the house one; the machinery to act on the answer now exists either way. Correcting an earlier note in this file: **main's copies are not partial** — Raghuvaṃśa there has 1,637 verses against tier A's 1,569, and is complete in three of the four.

- **Two faults the project lead's own screenshot surfaced, both fixed and republished.** GRETIL was merging its romanised mūla into one sanskritsahitya had already supplied in Devanagari, so the Raghuvaṃśa carried **59 starred variant verses and 8 half-verses in Latin letters**, interleaved with the Devanagari and repeating what the verse above them said. A higher tier now claims a layer id and a lower one does not write it — GRETIL is the fallback for a work tier A lacks, not a second opinion on one it has. And the shared layers had no Sanskrit name, so the chip row read `सञ्जीविनी | Padaccheda | Anvaya | Translation En` in a UI that is Devanagari-first everywhere else; they are now पदच्छेदः, अन्वयः, आङ्ग्लानुवादः, हिन्द्यनुवादः. The corpus is 24 works / 49 layers / **66,977 entries** after the cleanup.

- **Corpus search could never find a verse in a shloka-based grantha, and still cannot until someone runs the reindex.** `build_search_index.py`'s `extract_text` read `text` or `sanskrit` from a nested shloka; every DGE grantha writes `sanskrit_text`. So the Rāmāyaṇa, the Mahābhārata, the Purāṇas and the stotras all indexed as **empty stubs** — which is the real reason the committed index looked stale. Fixed, and verified: Bāla Kāṇḍa goes from 0 to 76 units with text. Two additions came with it: `--extra-data`, which indexes a corpus rooted elsewhere with slugs relative to that root (so the Kāvya corpus is searchable while its 50 MB stays on `kavya-dist`), and `--commentaries`, off by default, which folds each shloka's `bhashya[]` and `artha` in — that is what makes Mallinātha searchable, at a size cost. `core.js` sends a hit on a `kavya_alankara/` grantha to the CDN, so opening it works. `reindex.yml` takes both switches. **Not run here**: `dge/search_index` is 286 MB on main and a rebuild changes all of it, so what it grows to — and whether the commentaries go in — is the project lead's call. Verified on a subset: वागर्थाविव finds the Raghuvaṃśa mūla and the Sañjīvinī; कश्चित्कान्ता finds the Meghadūta.

- **The Kāvya corpus is deployed and live, and five things about it are open.** The package that arrived as `dgekavyacorpus.zip` is in: `tools/kavya/**`, `dge/kavya.html` + `js/kavya.js` + `css/kavya.css`, `patches/`, `tests/` (58 tests, all passing), and `.github/workflows/import-kavya.yml`. The built corpus — **24 works, 49 layers, 67,169 entries, 50 MB** — is on this repo's `kavya-dist` branch and served over jsDelivr from `appConfig.kavyaDataBase`, the same arrangement as the koshas and the WordNet, and for the same reason: it never goes on `main`, where it would put the site back over the GitHub Pages 1 GB limit. Its own DEPLOY.md said it "can live in the app repo" — that was written against an older size picture and is not true today.
  - **Four works now exist twice, and that needs a decision.** `raghuvamsha`, `kumarasambhava`, `kiratarjuniya` and `shishupalavadha` are already published from `dge/data/kavya_alankara/` in the pre-package shape (items keyed `sarga_01`, shlokas keyed by `number`), and the corpus branch carries a far fuller copy of each — mūla plus **Mallinātha** (Sañjīvinī, Ghaṇṭāpatha, Sarvaṅkaṣā), padaccheda, anvaya and translations, 1,569 verses for Raghuvaṃśa against the 19-sarga copy on main. They are not merged: `merge_into_existing` matches items by id and shlokas by id, so merging would have **appended a second copy of each text rather than updating it** — 19 sargas becoming 38, silently, in a live grantha. It now raises `MergeShapeError` and refuses instead of crashing on a missing `grantha` block, which is what it did the first time it met a real repo file. Writing the id bridge (`sarga_01` ↔ `1`, `number` ↔ `id`) and deciding which copy is canonical is the follow-up.
  - **26 of the 58 declared works have no machine-readable source**, and now say so in `works.json` instead of erroring on every run. 8 were already the scan-only register; the other 18 were declared with GRETIL filenames that never existed — checked one by one against GRETIL's own index, which has no Naiṣadhīyacarita, no Mṛcchakaṭika, no Mudrārākṣasa, no Bhavabhūti at all. Bhartṛhari's three śatakas are one GRETIL file and nothing splits a file between works, so all three are parked rather than importing the whole śatakatraya three times. Wikisource and Ambuda are the obvious next places to look; nobody has.
  - **Six sources parse to nothing** (Amaruśataka, Bhāsa's Dūtavākya, Harṣacarita, Kāvyaprakāśa mūla and its Bālabodhinī, Rasagaṅgādhara): their GRETIL files carry no reference marker in any convention the parser knows. Left out rather than published as empty layers, which is what `verify_kavya` was failing on.
  - **The genre taxonomy patch was not applied.** `patches/apply_taxonomy_patch.py` expects `taxonomy.json` to be id/children nodes; since the Round 5 restructure it is a nested plain dict whose path IS the data path, so the patch aborts with "kavya_alankara not found". Applying the genre tree there would also mean the data paths have to grow a genre level. The reader groups by genre itself from `works.json`, so nothing is lost today.
  - **Tier A's licence is the same open question as the koshas'.** `sanskritsahitya-com/data` has no LICENSE file; it is the ashtadhyayi.com team, for whom the project lead holds educational/non-commercial permission. Attribution travels in every layer's `license` field and in the branch README. Re-confirm before any public launch.

- **A regression of my own, found while moving the audio and fixed with it (`72e8fb4`): the Sumadhva Vijaya recordings had been 404ing since the taxonomy restructure.** All 16 sargas stored `archiveBaseUrl: "data/kavya/sumadhva_vijaya/assets/"`, the pre-restructure path. `migrate_slugs.py` rewrote cross-references, backlinks, manifest slugs and shard names, and did not touch `archiveBaseUrl` inside a grantha's `metadata` — so every verse of the Madhva Vijaya asked for audio at a path that no longer existed, and nothing said so, because a missing recording fails quietly. Worth a general lesson: **the restructure's blind spot was URLs inside metadata**, and anything else of that shape is worth a look. Raghavendra Vijaya's ten sargas carried the same stale prefix for audio that exists nowhere at all; repointed to its own identifier so the files work the day they arrive.

- ~~**Should the 7 Ashtadhyayi/Dhatupatha files be exposed in the main Library browser?**~~ **Decided — yes — and they already are.** Checked before changing anything: all seven are in `library.json`, all seven are in `taxonomy.json`, and the Library modal shows वेदाङ्गानि › व्याकरणम् (9) → अष्टाध्यायी (6) plus Dhātupāṭha. A later session registered them and the note here went stale. `register_layers.py` will stop re-surfacing them.

- **Ananda Ramayana and Adbhuta Ramayana go under `itihasa/ramayana`, and a `misc` node holds what is undecided** (`0ce7a91`) — both the project lead's call. Neither Ramayana is sourced yet, so they are empty leaves; `misc` holds "Ajaya Vijayendra" and the Satyadhyana Tirtha civil suit until what they are is settled, and says so in its own note. **One thing to decide before they are filled:** Valmiki's seven kandas sit directly under `ramayana`, so these two now stand as their siblings — a work beside a chapter. The clean shape is a `valmiki` node holding the kandas, but that renames seven live slugs and everything referencing them, so it wants its own pass with `migrate_slugs.py` rather than being done incidentally.

- **Grantha acquisition list dictated 18 Aug 2026 — 16 lines to source and load, plus a two-way Veda↔saint linking requirement that is half-built. Several titles came through a voice transcription garbled; my readings are recorded beside the raw words rather than silently corrected, and the flagged ones need the project lead's own confirmation before anyone goes hunting for a text. Bṛhatī Sahasra has since been confirmed; two remain open.** Nothing here is sourced yet — this is the wanted-list, not a status report.

  | Dictated as | Read as | Confidence | Where it would sit |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | "Jayateertha Vijaya" | Jayatīrtha Vijaya | high | `kavya_alankara/` (vijaya-kāvya), cross-linked to `jayatirtha` in the parampara |
  | "Satyasantha Vijaya" | Satyasandha Vijaya | high | same; saint node `satyasandha` |
  | "Satyabodha Vijaya" | Satyabodha Vijaya | high — already named in `parampara.json` under `satyabodha` ("Satyabodha Vijaya (kavya)") | same |
  | "Raghuuttama Vijaya" | Raghūttama Vijaya | high; saint node `raghuttama` exists | same |
  | "Satyadhyana Vijaya or some mahakavyas of Satyadhyana Tirtha" | Satyadhyāna Vijaya, and other mahākāvyas of Satyadhyāna Tīrtha (Uttarādi Maṭha, 1872–1942) | high for the person, open for which works | same; note Satyadhyāna Tīrtha has **no node** in `parampara.json` yet |
  | "Vijayandra Vijaya" (earlier message) | Vijayīndra Vijaya | high; saint node `vijayindra` exists | same |
  | "Ajaya Vijayendra" (earlier message) | **unclear** — possibly "Ajeya Vijayīndra", possibly a duplicate of the line above, possibly a distinct work | **low — confirm** | unknown |
  | "Gita Prathipadartha Chandrika" | Gītā Pratipadārtha Candrikā | high | `darshana/vedanta/dvaita/…/gita_prasthana` |
  | "Civil Suit of Satyadhyana Tirtha" | **unclear** — reads as the Uttarādi Maṭha litigation record rather than a grantha; could equally be a mis-transcription of a Sanskrit title | **low — confirm.** If it really is the court record, it is an archival document, not a grantha, and needs its own home (and a licence check) rather than a taxonomy leaf | unknown |
  | "Vishnu Sahasranama with all its commentaries of Madhva saints" | Viṣṇusahasranāma + every Mādhva vyākhyāna — and see the Bṛhatī Sahasra note below, which tradition holds is its verse-by-verse counterpart | high | `stotra/` mūla with per-commentator layers. `parampara.json` already names two: `satyanidhi` ("Vishnu-Sahasranama Vyakhyana") and `satyasandha` ("commentary on Vishnu-Sahasranama") — a starting list, not a complete one |
  | "Veda Sukta … vyakhyanas by Madhva saints" | Sūkta vyākhyānas (Puruṣa Sūkta &c.) by Mādhva saints | high; `satyasandha` already carries "Purusha-Sukta commentary" | `vedas/` as a commentary layer — see the linking requirement below |
  | "Brihati Sahasra" | Bṛhatī Sahasra — **confirmed by the project lead, then checked online at their asking**: an aggregate of a thousand mantras, not the bṛhatī chandas. A real technical term (MW glosses it "a thousand bṛhatīs", attested in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra), and in Mādhva practice a chanted collection with its own printed commentary | high on what it is; **the extent is still open** — see below | `vedas/` — as a named collection over its constituent ṛks, if they turn out to be ṛks we already hold |
  | "Pomaana Sukta" (earlier dictation: "Paumana") | Pavamāna Sūkta vyākhyānas | high | `vedas/` |
  | "Ananda Ramayana" (18 Aug) | Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa | high | `itihasa/` beside Vālmīki, or `purana/` — it is traditionally classed with the Purāṇas, so the placement is a real call, not a default |
  | "Adbhuta Ramayana" (18 Aug) | Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa | high | same question, same answer needed |
  | "Smrutimuktaavali and Smrutis" | Smṛtimuktāvalī, and the Smṛtis generally | high | `smriti_dharma/smriti` — the node exists and is empty |

  **Bṛhatī Sahasra — what the search actually turned up, and the one thing it did not.** Searched at the project lead's asking; worth writing down because it changes what we would be loading. Caveat first: `madhwakart.com`, `wisdomlib.org`, `anandsp1.wordpress.com` and `texasgaushala.com` are all blocked by this sandbox's egress proxy, so every line below comes from search-result summaries rather than from a page actually read here. Treat it as a lead to verify against a printed copy, not as sourcing.
  - **The term is real and old.** Monier-Williams glosses *bṛhatī-sahasra* as "a thousand bṛhatīs", attested in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra — a ritual measure of chant, counted in bṛhatī units, long before any Mādhva usage.
  - **In Vaiṣṇava and Mādhva tradition it is tied directly to the Viṣṇusahasranāma**, which matters here because the project lead wants both. The reported correspondence is one-to-one: each of the thousand names answers to one mantra of the Bṛhatī Sahasra, said to belong to the Ṛgveda. The syllable arithmetic used to justify it is given two different ways by two different sources — 36 akṣaras per verse in one, 36 svaras + 36 vyañjanas = 72 in another — which is a fair warning about the level these accounts are pitched at. If we ever ship the name↔mantra alignment it should come off the printed text, not off that arithmetic.
  - **It is chanted, and it is in print.** A "Bṛhatī Sahasra Mahā Mantra Homa" is performed at Mādhva maṭhas, and Madhwakart lists both a two-part *Bruhati Sahasra* and a separate *Bruhati Sahasra Pradīpa* — so the commentary the project lead asked for exists as a published book, likely Kannada.
  - **What no search answered: which thousand.** No source found gives the extent — which mantras, in what order, from which maṇḍalas or śākhās. That single fact decides the data shape. If they are Ṛgveda mantras we already hold, the collection is a **manifest over existing ids** (`vedas/rigveda/shakala_shakha/samhita/mandala_09` alone has 1,108, each with a stable id like `9.1.1` beside its pada-pāṭha, ṛṣi, devatā and chandas) and costs almost nothing. If it draws across śākhās or carries its own recension, it needs its own text. Either way a second copy of verses we already have would give the site two Rigvedas that drift apart and split every backlink between them — so the manifest is the default, and the printed Pradīpa's own table of contents is the thing to get hold of. The same reasoning covers Puruṣa Sūkta and Pavamāna Sūkta as named sūktas, and conveniently the addressing a manifest needs (`<grantha-slug>#<unit-id>`) is exactly what `references[].target` already uses.
  Where this came from, so the next person can go straight to it: `wisdomlib.org/definition/brihatisahasra` (the MW gloss and the Brāhmaṇa/Śrauta-sūtra attestations), `madhwakart.com/product/bruhati-sahasra/` and `.../bruhati-sahasra-pradeepa/` (the two-part text and its Pradīpa), `naadopaasana.wordpress.com/tag/vishnu-sahasranama/` and `hindupedia.com/en/Vishnu_Sahasranamam` (the name↔mantra correspondence and the two versions of the syllable count), `texasgaushala.com/post/a-call-to-harmony-bruhati-sahasra-maha-yajna` (the homa), plus a scanned *Bruhathi Sahasra* PDF circulating on Scribd/pdfcoffee that would settle the extent question if someone can open it and check its contents page.

  **The structural requirement, which is the harder half and the reason this is not just a shopping list.** In the project lead's own words: a sūkta vyākhyāna should live under the Veda section *and* show up under the individual saint's contributions — "If someone clicks on that verse, the commentary should appear, or if one goes to a particular saint, his vyakhyanas should be seen there." Two directions, and they are in very different states today:

  - **Verse → commentary is already the backlinks mechanism, and needs no new design.** A commentary unit declares `references[].target` pointing at `<grantha-slug>#<unit-id>`; `tools/shard_backlinks.py` inverts that into `dge/search_index/backlinks.json` plus per-cited-grantha shards, and `dge/js/backlinks.js` decorates each verse row with a count and a list of who discusses it. What is missing is only *coverage*: exactly three cited texts have shards today (`ashtadhyayi/sutrapatha`, `ashtadhyayi/kashika`, `sarvamula/sutra_prasthana/anuvyakhyana`). No Vedic saṃhitā is a backlink target yet, so a reader on a Rigveda verse sees nothing. Pointing a sūkta vyākhyāna's units at their mantras and re-running the sharder is the whole job on this side — worth saying plainly, because it means the Veda-side requirement is a data task, not a feature build.
  - **Saint → his vyākhyānas does not exist, and the pieces for it are closer than they look.** `dge/guru-parampara/data/parampara.json` already holds 215 saint nodes, 50 of which carry a `works` array (138 entries) — but those are free-text strings ("Bhavaprakashika (on Gita Bhashya)"), linked to nothing. On the other side, 1,049 `data.json` files carry a `default_author`. Joining the two is the missing index, and the obstacle is naming, not plumbing: those 1,049 files spell their authors 192 different ways across Latin and Devanagari — "Sri Jayatirtha" (33 files) and "श्रीजयतीर्थः" (21) are the same person to a reader and two strings to a machine, and 143 files leave the field empty. So the work is (1) a canonical saint id on each grantha — reusing `parampara.json`'s existing ids (`jayatirtha`, `raghuttama`, `vijayindra`) rather than inventing a second vocabulary, (2) a generated author→granthas index, and (3) `works` entries growing an optional path so a saint's page links into the library instead of merely naming a title. Not started, and not to be started before the acquisition list above is confirmed — the shape of the index should be settled against real texts, not guessed ahead of them.

- **Custom domain `www.sarvamula.org` goes live 29 Aug 2026, or 18 Sep if that slips — the switchover is now a checklist, not a hunt.** The `CNAME` file was deleted from `main` on 17 Aug, so GitHub Pages currently serves `tribhuvanachar.github.io/bhumandala` only. Almost nothing in the site cares: the reader resolves its links relatively and its JavaScript uses `location.origin`, both of which follow whatever domain served the page. The one exception is the Open Graph `og:image` in the root `index.html` — the portrait shown in WhatsApp/Telegram/X link previews — which must be fully qualified and is read by crawlers that never run JavaScript, so it cannot be resolved at runtime. That URL is now managed: `site.config.json` holds `siteOrigin`, the tag is marked `<!-- site-url: ... -->`, and `tools/set_site_url.py` rewrites it. **On go-live day:** restore `CNAME`, run `python3 tools/set_site_url.py --set https://www.sarvamula.org`, set `customDomain.status` to `live`, and — the one that bites silently — add both `www.sarvamula.org` and `sarvamula.org` to Firebase → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains, or Google Sign-In stops working on the new domain with no error message. The full checklist is in `site.config.json` itself; `--check` verifies the repo is in sync and is worth adding to any pre-delivery check run.

- **Two delivered drop-in patches confirmed NOT yet implemented/merged — checked file-by-file against the live repo, not guessed from filenames.** `dgecommentaryimport.zip`: 4 new GitHub-Actions-driven importers (Ramayana word-gloss commentary from valmikiramayan.net, Mahabharata Ganguli PD English translation, a new standalone Bhagavad Gita section under Itihasas with the `gita/gita` open dataset + optional GitaSupersite classical bhashyas, a new top-level Shankaracharya bhashya section from the Zenodo GRETIL CC-BY dump) plus `ingest-commentaries.yml`/`validate_data.py`/`register_layers.py` — none of the 5 new importer files, 3 new tooling/workflow files, or `taxonomy.json` nodes (`bhagavad_gita`, `shankara_bhashya`) exist in this repo.
  **Update — deployed and Bhagavad Gita ingested (verified, merged); the other 3 queued for their own Actions smoke tests (all 4 sources are blocked from this sandbox directly, confirmed by curl — same block pattern as GRETIL/Dasa Sahitya).** Before shipping `bhagavadgita.py`, ran its real logic locally against the live `github.com/gita/gita` dataset (the one source of these four actually reachable here): all 18 chapters matched their standard verse counts exactly (701/701 total), and the base dataset already carries real classical bhashyas per verse -- including **Sri Madhavacharya's own Gita Bhashya at 700/701** -- so GitaSupersite's optional, slow (Wayback-Machine-dependent, thousands of individual fetches, one shloka+flag combination at a time) enrichment wasn't needed for a useful first pass and wasn't enabled. Added a 0.5s request delay to `mahabharata_ganguli.py` (the delivered version had none at all across what could be thousands of fetches over 18 books) to match this project's own established crawler politeness convention. Fixed `tools/register_layers.py`'s own indent (1→2) before it ever ran for real -- the delivered version would have reformatted all of `library.json` on its first run, the exact json.dump mistake already caught and fixed once this session on this same file.
  **Real regression caught and fixed in `taxonomy.json` before it shipped:** naively adding the new `saartha`/`translation_ganguli` layers as a bare new child key under each Ramayana kanda/Mahabharata parva would have turned that node from a taxonomy LEAF into an internal node, silently dropping its EXISTING `/mula` content from `gen_library_status.py`'s leaf-counting (which only counts leaves with no children). Fixed by adding an explicit `"mula": {}` sibling alongside each new layer at all 24 affected nodes; verified with a real before/after run that `loaded`/`items` totals were byte-identical (177 / 307,731) except the expected +54 new not-yet-populated leaves.
  **Bhagavad Gita ingested and merged**: 18 adhyayas, 701/701 verses, real per-verse `bhashya[]` from ~20 translators/commentators. One side-effect caught and fixed before merging its PR: `register_layers.py` correctly finds every *unregistered* `data.json` on disk, which also picked up 7 pre-existing files (`vedanga/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/*`, `vedanga/vyakarana/dhatupatha`) that were never added to `library.json` — separately confirmed via `gen_library_status.py`'s own comment that Ashtadhyayi is deliberately excluded from the main library.json-driven reader (its own standalone feature/page). Stripped those 7 out of the Gita PR before merging rather than silently folding an unrelated feature's exposure decision into this one.
  **New, real, standalone finding needing the project lead's own call:** should `vedanga/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/{balamanorama,kashika,nyasa,sutrapatha,tattvabodhini,vasu}/data.json` and `vedanga/vyakarana/dhatupatha/data.json` (7 files, all real content, currently reachable only via the dedicated Ashtadhyayi/Dhātupāṭha pages) also be exposed through the MAIN site's Library browser modal (by adding them to `library.json`)? Nothing was changed either way — `register_layers.py` will keep re-surfacing these 7 as "new" on every future run of ANY importer until this is decided one way or the other.
  **Ramayana word-meaning (`saartha`) ingested and merged: 5 of 6 kandas.** bala/ayodhya/aranya/kishkindha/yuddha, real word-by-word gloss + English (opening verse of Bala Kanda spot-checked against the well-known text). `sundara_kanda` failed cleanly — `discover_sargas()` found no sarga links on its contents page, exactly the "if a kanda yields 'no sargas discovered', the contents-page filename... needs a tweak" case the importer's own docstring already anticipated. Can't fix from here (valmikiramayan.net is blocked from this sandbox); needs someone who can actually load `https://www.valmikiramayan.net/sundara/sundara_contents.htm` (or whatever its real path is) to find the right pattern for `_sarga_page_url`/`SARGA_HREF` for that one kanda specifically.
  **Update — a candidate fix applied, NOT yet confirmed against the real site.** A Cowork session with real network access reported Sundara's contents page writes its sarga links with looser href quoting (single-quoted/unquoted, and not reliably carrying a literal `sargaN` token in a double-quoted href) than the other five kandas, which is why the original `href="[^"]*sarga(\d+)[^"]*\.htm"` pattern matched zero links there. `SARGA_HREF` was generalized to key off the per-sarga FRAME filename (`<prefix>_<N>_frame.htm`, uniform across all six kandas per `_sarga_page_url()`'s own docstring) with tolerant quoting instead: `href\s*=\s*["\']?([^"\'>\s]*?(\d+)_frame\.htm)`. Verified from this sandbox (no direct site access here either — same block) with a synthetic-HTML regex test: byte-identical matches on the 5 already-working kandas' real known href format, and correctly matches hypothetical single-quoted/unquoted/spaced variants that the old pattern missed. **What's NOT verified: that this is actually Sundara's real quirk.** The handoff explicitly asked for a live `discover_sargas('sundara','sundara_contents')` run confirming ~68 real sarga URLs before handing back a fix; that confirmation wasn't included with this diff. Applied anyway since it's strictly backward-compatible (provably no regression on the 5 working kandas) and can only help, not hurt, Sundara's current zero-sarga state — but treat "Sundara Kanda ingested" as still open until a real run (e.g. via GitHub Actions, or `python importers/ramayana_saartha.py`) actually confirms real Sundara Kanda content comes out.
  **Shankaracharya bhashya ingested and merged: 3 of 13 works.** Brahmasutra Bhashya (556 units) and Gita Bhashya (1175 units, per-verse keyed) both real, spot-checked (Brahmasutra's opening unit matches the known adhikarana-sutra text). Aitareya Upanishad Bhashya (59 units) also real. The other 9 Upanishads (Zenodo) and 2 of 3 remaining GRETIL-classic works (Kena/Katha/Mundaka) all 404'd — the exact "GRETIL marker formats vary... verify filenames on first run" case the importer's docstring flagged. Needs someone with real access to `zenodo.org/records/6466333/files/` and `gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de` (both blocked from this sandbox) to find the current correct filenames for `shankara_bhashya.py`'s `WORKS` list.
  **Update — 6 of the 9 stuck Upanishads re-pointed to real, verified URLs; Kena/Katha/Mundaka confirmed genuinely unavailable, not just misnamed.** A Cowork session with real network access found the root cause: Zenodo record 6466333 is only a SUBSET of GRETIL's corpus — of the Shankara set it ships just Brahmasutra + Aitareya as `.txt` (both already correctly ingested above), never the other 9. Confirmed by direct fetch that Isha/Prashna/Mandukya/Taittiriya/Chandogya/Brihadaranyaka bhashyas actually live on GRETIL itself under a different, newer tree — `corpustei/transformations/html/sa_*.htm` — and that all six return real IAST Sanskrit + Shankara's commentary there. `WORKS` re-pointed for those six (`fmt` stays `iast_htm`, same generic tag-stripping + reference-marker split `parse_units()` already uses successfully for the working `bhgsbh_u.htm` classic page, so the differing corpustei markup shouldn't matter — but this specific claim is NOT independently confirmed against real fetched content, see caveat below). Kena/Katha/Mundaka are a real, structural dead end, not a filename typo: GRETIL's own index marks them "restricted / not available from TITUS," and the old classic `1_veda/4_upa/` paths 404. Commented out (not deleted) in `WORKS`, pending a separate follow-up to wire in the `sanskritdocuments.org` ITX fallback the module's docstring already anticipated for the Gita bhashya — deliberately not built in the same pass, to keep this diff small and reviewable.
  **What's NOT verified here:** this sandbox can't reach either `zenodo.org` or `gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de` (same block as always), so the six corrected URLs and the `parse_units()` segmentation of corpustei's TEI-derived markup (mūla lines tagged e.g. `ChUp_1,1.1`, commentary `ChUpBh_1,1.1`) haven't been proven end-to-end from here — only that the module imports cleanly and `WORKS` now has exactly the intended 9 live entries (6 corpustei + brahmasutra/aitareya on Zenodo + gita_bhashya on classic GRETIL) with Kena/Katha/Mundaka correctly absent. Needs a real run (`python importers/shankara_bhashya.py`, or via GitHub Actions) to confirm real unit counts for the six re-pointed Upanishads before calling this "13 of 13 reachable works ingested."
  **Recurring side effect across all 4 PRs, now a confirmed pattern, not a one-off:** every single one of these ingests independently triggered `register_layers.py` to also pick up the same 7 pre-existing, deliberately-unregistered Ashtadhyayi/Dhatupatha files (see above) — stripped from each PR before merging. This will keep happening on *every* future run of *any* importer until the underlying Ashtadhyayi library.json-exposure question is actually decided. Worth resolving soon just to stop the repeated manual strip.
  **Mahabharata Ganguli translation ingested and merged: 16 of 18 parvas.** Real English prose confirmed (Adi Parva opens with Ganguli's own well-known translator's preface). Per-book section counts: adi 237, vana 313, udyoga 199, drona 199, bhishma 124, karna 96, sabha 80, virata 72, ashvamedhika 92, ashramavasika 39, shalya 65, stri 26, sauptika 18, mausala 8, mahaprasthanika 3, svargarohana 6. **Shanti Parva (book 12) and Anushasana Parva (book 13) — the two longest, most complex parvas — both came back completely empty, and failed near-instantly rather than timing out** (the job log shows the "book 12 ..."/"book 13 ..." print lines landing within the same second, meaning the very first section fetch failed immediately for both, not after working through some sections first). That pattern points to `sacred-texts.com` using a different URL or section-numbering convention for those two books specifically, not a rate-limit or transient failure. Can't diagnose further from here (site blocked from this sandbox) — a 4th Cowork handoff file (`FIX_MAHABHARATA_SHANTI_ANUSHASANA.md`) covering this specifically should be sent alongside the other 3 already delivered.
  ~~`dge_library_curation.zip`: a rewritten Library Manager...~~ **Done — merged.** `dge/js/library.js` v3.0 now reads an optional `dge/data/library-overrides.json` (hide/pin/reorder/rename/move, non-destructive — `taxonomy.json`/`library.json` and the real fetch path are never touched; navigation still resolves to the true slug even after a display-only move) as a superset of the old hide-only `library-visibility.json`, which is still honored as a fallback. `dge/library-admin.html` rewritten to match (previously hide-only). Added `.github/workflows/reindex.yml` (the admin page's "↻ Re-index search" button deep-links to it) and wired `dge/build_search_index.py` into `ingest.yml` so new content is searchable in the same PR that adds it. Ran both generators once by hand while at it — `dge/search_index/**` and `library_status.json` were genuinely stale (missing Sumadhva Vijaya, the Ashtadhyayi commentary layers, Vyasakuta), not just untested; now current (177/601 folders loaded, 307,731 items). Verified in a real browser: the seed (empty) overrides file renders byte-for-byte identical to the pre-change tree; a test file exercising all four override types (hide/pin/rename/move) produced exactly the right DOM change each time with zero regressions to the other 181 entries; the admin UI's hide/pin toggles and Export button work and produce the documented JSON shape. Not carried over from the admin tool's design: pin/reorder apply *within* the existing folders-then-leaves render grouping rather than one fully-merged sibling list across both — a deliberate smaller scope to avoid restructuring how the tree renders folders vs. leaves; noting here rather than silently diverging from the delivered spec.

- **Dasa Sahitya importer deployed (Haridasa padas/suladis/ugabhogas), triggered on GitHub Actions since it needs network the sandbox lacks — but flagging one real architectural overlap before it's merged.** Another Cowork session built a 7-source crawler (madhwafestivals.com, dasasahitya.net recursive, meerasubbarao, dasasahithyamahithi.com, lyricsraaga.com, kannada.dasasahitya.net stub, Raghavendra Vijaya) with cross-source dedup and count reporting, but couldn't fetch from its own sandbox (same block confirmed directly from here too — all 5 host domains returned a 403 policy denial, same as GRETIL/the CDNs). Deployed as designed: `tools/dasa_sahitya/` (importer + config), `.github/workflows/import-dasa-sahitya.yml` (workflow_dispatch → opens a PR, same pattern as `ingest.yml` — never pushes directly), `dge/dasa_sahitya.html` (browser page, smoke-tested against the delivered sample fixture in a real headless browser — renders, filters, script-switches correctly, no console errors; the fixture itself was removed before committing, not shipped as if real), new `dasa_pada_text` schema in `schemas.json` and a `dasa_sahitya` taxonomy node (both reformatted to match this repo's actual existing conventions, not pasted verbatim from the delivered patch, which used a different shape).
  **Real overlap, not yet reconciled:** this repo already has a `dasakuta` taxonomy node + matching `dge/data/dasakuta/<composer>/<form>/` folder scaffold (Purandaradasa, Kanakadasa, Vijayadasa, Gopaladasa, Jagannathadasa, Prasannavenkatadasa, Mahipatidasa — pada_kirtane/suladi/ugabhoga/mundige/dandaka/other_compositions each) — built earlier, still entirely empty, and covering the exact same subject as this new corpus. The new importer's own output shape (composer-file JSON with dedup/`also_at`, IAST/Devanagari auto-transliteration, source attribution) doesn't match `dasakuta`'s per-form-folder convention (matching every other grantha in the library), so this ships as a second, separate representation rather than filling in `dasakuta` directly. Whether to (a) keep both, (b) migrate the crawler's output into `dasakuta`'s existing folder shape once real data exists, or (c) retire `dasakuta` in favor of this corpus is a real catalog-organization call for the project lead, not something to decide unilaterally — flagged here rather than guessed. The PR the workflow opens is the natural checkpoint to make that call before merging.
  **Update — smoke test (limit=2/index) ran clean, real numbers inspected, full crawl then triggered.** PR #24 (`import/dasa-sahitya`) opened by the workflow: 136 unique compositions (0 cross-source dups reported), 94 pada / 16 suladi / 5 ugabhoga / rest smaller forms, from madhwafestivals.wordpress.com (105) + madhwafestivals.com (19) + dasasahitya.net (10) + meerasubbarao.wordpress.com (2) — `dasasahithyamahithi.com`/`lyricsraaga.com`/the kannada.dasasahitya.net stub yielded 0 in the smoke test, worth checking once the full run's own step logs are in. 77/136 (57%) came back with `composer: ""` ("untitled" bucket) — traced this to the importer's own code (`import_dasa_sahitya.py`, generic-source crawl path, `page_links[:limit_per_index]`): composer attribution comes from *which category/index page a song's link was first discovered under*, and `limit_per_index=2` caps how many links get kept per index page — with a cap that low, most songs get discovered via a deity/theme listing before their own composer listing is ever reached, so they never pick up a composer tag. This reads as a smoke-test artifact of the artificially low cap, not a structural bug — confirmed by re-reading the crawl logic directly rather than guessing. Also spotted one garbled composer slug (a raw percent-encoded Kannada title leaking into the `composer` field for one Vyasaraja-related entry) worth a follow-up look once real full-crawl data is in front of us. Given the artifact explanation held up on inspection, triggered the FULL crawl (no `limit_per_index`, `delay=1.0`) rather than stopping at the smoke test — same workflow, will force-update `import/dasa-sahitya`/PR #24 in place with real production data once it completes. Still not merged; still needs the project lead's `dasakuta` call above before it lands.
  **Update — full crawl landed, PR #24 merged, `dasakuta` question asked and answered ("keep both for now").** Real full-crawl numbers: 1,414 fetched → **1,396 unique** compositions (18 cross-source dups merged), 1,246 with actual verse text. By form: 1,189 pada / 75 suladi / 33 sampradaya / 27 mangala / 18 aarati / 16 laali / 11 kavya / 8 ugabhoga / 7 shobhane / 6 dashavatara / 5 kolu / 1 mixed — still nothing under mundige/dandaka (neither source site appears to index those separately; see the capture tool below for tagging them by hand). Composer attribution improved from 57% "untitled" (smoke test) to 32% (453/1,396) on the full run — confirms the earlier read that this was mostly a `limit_per_index` artifact, not a structural bug, though 453 unattributed compositions is still a real, non-trivial gap. `dasasahithyamahithi.com` (blocked from this sandbox, reachable from the Actions runner) came through with 97 on the full run; `lyricsraaga.com` and the `kannada.dasasahitya.net` stub still yielded 0 — worth checking those two sources' config entries specifically ***(resolved — see the "2 dead-end sources disabled" entry below)***. Asked the project lead directly (they were live in-session) whether to keep the crawler's own `composers/<slug>.json` (all-forms-per-file) shape or migrate to the pre-existing empty `dasa_sahitya/dasakuta/<composer>/<form>/` scaffold matching every other grantha — answer: **"keep both for now"**, i.e. merge PR #24 as-is and defer the folder-shape unification to a later cleanup pass. Merged (`30c8b7a`). `dasakuta` scaffold stays empty until that pass.
  **New: progress tracker + manual capture tool, per the project lead's direct request.** They asked for (a) a live count of how many padas/suladis/ugabhogas/mundiges/dandakas etc. are filled, (b) visibility into which source links didn't come out well so they can click through them by hand (up to 100-200/day, by their own estimate), and (c) a way to select lyrics text in their own browser on a source site and get it saved into the right composer's file without going through the crawler. Built `dge/dasa_capture.html` (superadmin-gated, same pattern as Convert): a stats/form-count dashboard read straight from `index.json`; a review queue of `no_text`/`failed_fetch` URLs (now written by the importer itself — see below — instead of only going to stderr) with one-click "Capture this" prefill; a bookmarklet (drag to bookmarks bar, no install) that copies a selected page's lyrics + URL + title to the clipboard from *any* site, including the ones blocked from this sandbox, since it runs in the project lead's own real browser; a paste-and-parse capture form (composer/form/deity/raga/tala/tags/meaning + a live JSON preview in the exact `dasa_pada_text` shape); and a Save button that pushes the new record straight to GitHub — the target composer file, `index.json`'s counts, and a new `_dump/manual_captures.json` ledger (so a captured URL drops out of the review queue and a later re-crawl won't re-flag it) — all in one commit via the existing `convert/github.js`. Added `mundige`/`dandaka`/`other` to the form vocabulary (`dasa_sahitya.html`, `schemas.json`) so manual captures can tag those even though the crawler hasn't surfaced any yet. `import_dasa_sahitya.py` now collects fetch failures (`Fetcher.failed`) and no-verse-text pages into `_dump/pending_review.json` with reasons, plus a `pending` summary block in `index.json`, instead of only printing to stderr — the PR #24 run predates this, so the review queue will be empty until the next crawl (triggered again after this change, to populate it for real). Verified the whole tool end-to-end in a real headless browser against the real merged 1,396-record `index.json`: stats/form-table render correctly, queue tabs and "Capture this" prefill work, the bookmarklet's `javascript:` href is correctly constructed, the paste-parser correctly splits a bookmarklet-format block into stanzas, the live preview renders the exact target schema, and a full save (GitHub calls mocked to avoid pushing test data) produced the correct 3-file commit (composer file + `index.json` + ledger) with the right commit message. Not built: live IAST/Devanagari auto-transliteration for manually captured titles (crawler entries mostly lack it too — flagged, not solved); a true "expected total" completion percentage (unknowable — no source publishes an authoritative total count of all Haridasa compositions, so the tracker shows "found so far," not "% complete").

- **Dasa Sahitya: 2 dead-end sources verified with real network access and disabled — `lyricsraaga.com` and `kannada.dasasahitya.net`.** Both had yielded 0 compositions since the very first crawl, flagged above as needing a real look. Confirmed (not guessed): `lyricsraaga.com` is a fully client-side-rendered SPA — every route (the tag archive, individual song pages, `/wp-json/`, `/sitemap_index.xml`) returns only an empty app-shell to a non-browser client, so the crawler's plain-`requests` `Fetcher` gets 0 links no matter the URL pattern (its real song URLs are `/devotional/<slug>/` and `/kannada/<slug>/`, not the old `/…-lyrics/` pattern — corrected in the config for if a JS-capable fetcher is ever built). `kannada.dasasahitya.net` has an invalid TLS cert for its own hostname (`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`, a server-side misconfiguration, not a sandbox block), is unindexed by search (effectively defunct), and is redundant regardless — the already-working `dasasahitya.net` crawl (`parser: "dasasahitya"`, 69 composers) already serves Kannada-script content directly under Kannada-suffixed categories (e.g. `/category/krishna-ಕೃಷ್ಣ/`). Both composers' work (Purandara/Kanaka/Sripadaraja) is fully covered by `madhwafestivals` + `dasasahitya.net` already, so building headless-browser rendering for one heavily-overlapping source wasn't worth it. Added a small `"enabled": false` flag to each block in `dasa_sources.json` (a source with no `enabled` key defaults to enabled, so the 4 working sources + `raghavendra_vijaya` are untouched) and a matching skip-and-log guard in `import_dasa_sahitya.py`'s `crawl()`. Verified with a synthetic-config unit test (no network needed): a disabled source is skipped and logged (`[skip] <name>: <reason>`), an enabled one is still attempted. Expected result of the next Actions run: unchanged corpus (~1,396 compositions), two fewer 0-yield sources cluttering the log. Re-enable either only if a JS-capable fetcher is built (lyricsraaga) or someone confirms unique content at a valid-cert URL with real index pages (kannada_dasasahitya).

- **Vyākaraṇa module, "stage 15 vṛttis" handoff — built the missing foundation it depended on, shipped and browser-tested; scope narrower than the full master handoff doc.** The project lead's `DGE_Vyakarana_CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md` describes stages 0-15 as "already built and shipped" in a prior Cowork session, but this repo (checked directly, all branches/history) only ever had the base sūtra reader (the one `DGE_ashtadhyayi_DROP_IN.zip` sync from 8 Aug) — stages 1-14 (Dhātupāṭha, Gaṇapāṭha, Prakriyā/Śabda/Kṛdanta/Taddhitānta viewers, Uṇādi/Phiṭ/Liṅgānuśāsana/Vārttika, Pratyaya catalog, Paribhāṣā) were never actually delivered here, only described in the doc. The one zip actually supplied this session (`DGE_stage15_vrittis_DROP_IN.zip`) ships `dhatu.html`/`js/dhatu.js` + 1380 `vritti/<code>.json` files, but those depend entirely on `dhatupatha/data.json` (stage 1) existing, which it didn't.
  **What was actually built to make this real, not just dropped in inert:** confirmed GitHub is reachable from this environment (unlike gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de and the CDN domains, both blocked by the proxy policy) and `pip install vidyut` works — used vidyut's own Python bindings (MIT) to build `dge/tools/build_dhatupatha.py`, producing a real 2229-root `dge/data/vyakarana/dhatupatha/data.json` (code, Devanagari root with its traditional it-markers, artha, gaṇa — all directly from vidyut's authoritative data, gaṇa distribution matches the doc's own stated totals). `pada` (parasmaipada/ātmanepada) required real caution: a first attempt derived it from the wrong it-marker and called "paṭh" (पठ्, "to read" — genuinely parasmaipada, everyone's first-year Sanskrit) ātmanepada, with an implausible 181:2048 P:A split — caught by spot-checking before shipping, not after. The corrected rule (the OTHER it-marker) was cross-checked against 4 known roots before shipping, with an honest caveat in the data's own `note` field; ubhayapada roots aren't distinguished from parasmaipada, and seT/aniṭ was left out entirely rather than risk a second wrong guess (documented in the build script's own comment, including the exact wrong hypothesis and why it was wrong).
  Wired `dhatu.html`/`js/dhatu.js` in, added an Explore-menu link (`index.html`), and verified in a real headless browser: all 2229 roots load, search finds specific roots correctly, the pada field displays correctly for spot-checked roots (भू→Parasmaipada, एध्→Ātmanepada), and the वृत्तयः panel loads real GPL-licensed Mādhavīya commentary text (सायणः's actual gloss on एध्, with real derived forms) across all three vṛtti tabs with no console errors.
  **Not done, and explicitly out of scope for what was verifiable here:** T1 (Prakriyā/Śabda/Kṛdanta/Taddhitānta derivation viewers) — vidyut's `Vyakarana.derive()` Python API does work (tested directly: correctly derived "Bavati" for BU), but the site's `prakriya.js`/etc. expect a specific JSON shape from Rust generator scripts (`gen_prakriya_json.rs` etc.) that weren't in this handoff's zips, and guessing that shape without the reference scripts risked shipping JSON those pages can't actually render — safer to leave for whoever has the real generators. Ganapāṭha, Uṇādi/Phiṭ/Liṅgānuśāsana/Vārttika, Pratyaya catalog, Paribhāṣā (stages 6-12) are all still genuinely missing — vidyut's own downloaded data package (`prakriya/unadipatha.tsv`, `varttikas.tsv`, `kaumudi.tsv`, etc.) turned out to bundle several of these directly and could unblock T5 (authoritative Kaumudī order) too, a real, promising follow-up not pursued further given the time already spent getting stage 15 itself working end-to-end.

- **Prakasa Samhita (Pancharatra) ingested — first populated samhita in `agama/pancharatra/pancharatra_samhitas/` (the other 14 are still empty stubs).** Source: GRETIL corpustei TEI (`sa_prakAzasaMhitA.xml`), CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, project lead supplied it already converted IAST→Devanagari this session (matches `GRETIL_source_catalog.csv`'s own note: 1623 verses, `DONE_devanagari`). Parsed by marker `// ps_<paricchheda>,<adhyaya>.<verse> //`: 2 paricchhedas (15 + 6 adhyayas), 21 units total, 1623 shlokas — the parsed count matches the catalog's stated count exactly, and spot-checked first/last verses of both paricchhedas against the source text directly. Wired into `taxonomy.json` (new `prakasha_samhita` leaf) and `library.json` (new populated entry, positioned among its `pancharatra_samhitas` siblings, not appended out of place). Editorial/structural lines (colophons, "अथ...अध्यायः" chapter openers, "...उवाच" speaker tags) dropped, matching this corpus's own stated "mula only" convention and the same stray-line-drop approach `importers/gretil.py` already uses elsewhere.
  **Not done, and flagged rather than guessed:** no live-fetch importer was added to `importers/` for this text. GRETIL's own domain (`gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de`) is blocked by this environment's outbound proxy policy (confirmed via a direct request — 403 policy denial, same block as the CDN domains noted elsewhere in this doc), and the corpustei source is TEI-XML (a different structure than the plain-HTML/plaintext GRETIL pages `gretil.py` already parses) — building a live importer for an XML format I can't fetch to actually test against would mean shipping unverified parsing logic, so it wasn't done. The pre-converted Devanagari text (this session's upload) is the actual, verified source of the committed data; a live-fetch importer for future re-runs is a real follow-up task if wanted, ideally built/tested on a machine that can reach GRETIL directly (matches this repo's own existing pattern of running such importers via GitHub Actions, not this sandbox).
  Remaining `pancharatra_samhitas` stubs (Sattvata, Paushkara, Jayakhya, Ahirbudhnya, Ishvara, Parama, Padma, Vishnu, Naradiya, Lakshmi Tantra, Hayagriva, Parashara, Vasishtha, Vishvaksena) are still empty — `GRETIL_source_catalog.csv` shows most as `confirmed_on_gretil` (findable, not yet transliterated) or `gap_scanned` (only on archive.org as scans, needs OCR) — a real next task once sourced the same way Prakasa Samhita was.

- **Update (fresh Proofread run of sargas 10-13, using the just-fixed pipeline): confirmed clean and matches the source's own printed counts exactly — 10=56, 11=77 (78 per the project lead's reference, one verse still to insert), 12=54, 13=69 (matches the project lead's own "13.69" reference). No duplicate text, no missing pages.** One genuine content finding, not a bug: indices 57-58 (pages 122-123, between sarga 10 and 11) are a real editorial appendix — the book shows verses 10.48 and 10.54 rearranged into their *sarvatobhadra* (palindrome) and *chakrabandha* (wheel-pattern) citrakavya forms, not new narrative verses. Awaiting the project lead's call on how to fold this into `sarga_10`'s schema (extra commentary on shlokas 48/54, or set aside separately) before pushing sarga_10; sargas 11-13 have no open questions and are ready to push once asked.
  **Update (v0.33.0) — this citrakavya-appendix finding CONFIRMED with real data, root cause fixed, plus three more real bugs found the same way.** The project lead shared the actual PDF plus real Vision/Gemini API keys specifically so this could be tested end-to-end instead of only with synthetic fixtures. Ran the real pipeline against pages 119-124 (the exact sarga 10/11 boundary):
  1. **Root cause of the 57/58 "duplicate" confirmed directly, not inferred.** Real Vision OCR reproduced the page 122-123 text verbatim ("अस्मिन् काव्ये द्वौ बन्धौ कविना ग्रथितौ सर्वतोभद्रं च चक्रबन्धश्च... [१०.४८]" / "...चक्रबन्धग्रथितं... [१०.५४]"), and real Gemini proofreading of that text got it exactly right on its own: it gave every genuine shloka (45-56, then sarga 11's 1-4) a real `number`, but correctly left `number` OUT of the two appendix entries — a real, reliable signal Gemini already emits by itself, needing no prompt change. The actual bug was downstream: `mergeSavedProofreadChunks()` in `app.js` blindly assigned every entry the next sequential `index` regardless of whether Gemini gave it a real number, which is exactly how two appendix pages became fake shlokas "57" and "58". Fixed: an entry with no `number` still gets an index (nothing is dropped) but is now forced to `classification: "review"` with an explicit note pointing straight at the fix ("...delete this row in the schema editor below (numbering auto-adjusts) or merge it into the previous shloka") — closing the loop with the manual row editor shipped in v0.31.0. Verified in a real browser reproducing this exact real shloka sequence: the two appendix entries land in Review class C with the new note, and the schema still renders/builds cleanly around them.
  2. **A second, unrelated but serious real bug found along the way: this app's default AND fallback Gemini models are both dead for a freshly-issued API key.** `gemini-2.5-flash` (the hardcoded default in `js/gemini.js`, shared by every AI feature on the site) and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (its own one-step fallback) both returned a real 404 ("no longer available to new users") against the project lead's real key — even though `models.list` still lists both with `generateContent` support, which apparently doesn't reflect real per-key availability. With both primary and fallback dead, every AI feature site-wide (Convert, Kosha, Ashtadhyayi, main app chat) would fail outright for this exact key with no automatic recovery. Switched both to Google's own `-latest` rolling aliases (`gemini-flash-latest` / `gemini-flash-lite-latest`), confirmed working against the same key. Also fixed a user-facing error message in the same file that was suggesting the now-dead `gemini-2.5-flash` as the fix for a 404 — would have sent an affected user straight into a second 404.
  3. **Real evidence the default max-output-token budget is too low for genuinely dense classical-kavya text.** The same 6-page real Proofread run (verse + the citrakavya appendix + commentary-style explanation) hit `MAX_TOKENS` at the shared client's 8192-token default and only completed cleanly at 32768. Raised Convert's own effective default (when the admin hasn't typed a value) to 16384 — a real, evidence-backed floor specific to Convert's dense-JSON-dump use case, deliberately left the shared 8192 default untouched for other, lighter-weight Gemini features elsewhere on the site that don't need it.
  4. **A real discrepancy surfaced, not resolved — flagging rather than guessing.** The project lead's own manifest gave "11.1 अति-चित्र-धाम्नि" as sarga 11's opening verse. The real PDF (and real Gemini output from it) both show verse 1 as "प्रचुरान्तर-प्रवचनं फणि-राड्..." — "अति-चित्र-धाम्नि" is verse **2**, not 1, in this book's own printed numbering. Not fixed or assumed either way; needs the project lead to double-check their reference (possibly a different edition's numbering, or a transcription slip) before this specific manifest row is trusted.
  5. **Also caught and fixed while shipping this: EVERY per-file cache-bust query string in `index.html` except `app.js`/`style.css` had been stuck at `?v=0.30.1` since v0.30.2, despite `mapper.js`, `sarga-detect.js`, `renderer.js`, and both `gemini.js` files all being genuinely edited in the meantime** (the auto-split fix, the schema editor, the colophon support, and this round's model/merge fixes) — the exact same "stale cache-bust" class of bug already caught once this session for `app.js` alone, just wider than realized. All 17 script/style tags are now bumped together to the same version number every release, instead of trying to track each file's own version independently — the safer default going forward.
  All of the above (except item 4, which is a data question, not code) verified in a real browser; item 1's fix additionally verified against the real Gemini output it was built to handle, not just a synthetic approximation of it.
  **Update (v0.34.0) — the project lead asked for the same real test extended across the FULL sarga 10-12 range (pages 109-152, 44 pages), not just the one boundary. Found and fixed one more real bug, and got a strong end-to-end confirmation on the rest.**
  1. **Sandbox-specific hurdle, not an app bug**: this sandbox's egress proxy blocks `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`/`cdn.jsdelivr.net` (confirmed via `curl`, 403), which breaks pdf.js — so the real PDF couldn't be uploaded directly through a real headless browser here. Worked around it two ways without touching the real device path a real user actually uses: (a) Convert's own image-upload path (`loaders.js` → `image.js`) accepts pre-rendered page images directly, no pdf.js involved, so the real PDF's 44 pages were rendered to PNGs and fed in that way when driving the real browser UI; (b) even that hit a second, deeper sandbox quirk — this specific headless Chromium's own outbound requests to `vision.googleapis.com`/`generativelanguage.googleapis.com` were silently dropped before ever reaching the proxy (confirmed via the proxy's own relay logs: Chromium's background telemetry pings showed up there, a direct `page.goto()` to the same Vision URL did not), even with `--proxy-server` set explicitly — while the exact same real calls succeeded every time from plain Python `requests`/`curl` in this same sandbox. Rather than spend more time fighting a sandbox-specific network quirk unrelated to any real user's browser, ran the real OCR+Proofread via Python (proven working) and fed the real output into the real app's own IndexedDB exactly as a live run would leave it, then drove the real browser's own merge/auto-split/manifest-check code against that real data — same technique already used successfully throughout this session, just scaled up to real, full-range data instead of a synthetic fixture.
  2. **A second real, more consequential inconsistency in Gemini's own output found by comparing two independent real runs of the same source content**: a chapter boundary marker (colophon or chapter-opener) can land in EITHER the `sa` field or the `commentary` field depending on the run — confirmed directly: the first (6-page) run put sarga 10's closing colophon and sarga 11's opening line in `sa`; the second (44-page) run put BOTH of those same lines in `commentary` instead for the exact same page content. `sarga-detect.js`'s `detectAnchors()` only ever checked `sa`, so the second run's real output silently merged sarga 10 and 11 into one 133-shloka segment — exactly the kind of merge mistake this whole feature exists to prevent, just from a different cause than the already-fixed 57/58 case. Fixed: `detectAnchors()` now checks both fields. Re-ran the exact same real data after the fix: sarga 10 (56 shlokas), sarga 11 (77 — matches this project's own previously-documented real print count exactly), and sarga 12 (54, matching the project lead's manifest exactly) all split correctly. Also caught, while comparing the two runs, that Gemini fully OMITTED the citrakavya appendix pages (122-123) on this second run instead of including them unnumbered as it had the first time — a real, further inconsistency in how Gemini handles this specific tricky content, but not a gap in this app: the existing "N selected page(s) have no proofread text" warning (built well before this session, `lastProofreadMissingPages`) already exists precisely to catch a page contributing zero output, and would have fired on a real live Proofread run — it simply wasn't exercised by this test's IndexedDB-seeding shortcut, which bypasses the live run that computes it.
  3. **The manifest-check feature (v0.32.0) proved itself on real data in the same run**: fed it the project lead's real sarga 10/11/12 manifest against a page range that (deliberately, to see what would happen) started mid-sarga-9 and ended mid-sarga-13. It immediately flagged the top-level mismatch ("Manifest lists 3 chapter(s), but 5 were actually built") plus every per-chapter count/opening/closing mismatch that followed from that — exactly the kind of signal this feature was built to give, on a real run, not a contrived one.
  4. **A fourth real staleness bug, in the same family as the cache-bust fix directly above**: the visible "Version: X" text and this page's `<title>` were plain hardcoded HTML with no JS keeping them in sync — only the adjacent "Build: Y" text was ever actually wired up to the real `DGE_CONVERT_BUILD` variable. The version number shown on screen had been frozen at "0.30.1" for several releases (visible in the project lead's own earlier screenshots) while the real code moved on underneath it. Both now driven from `DGE_CONVERT_VERSION` at load time, the same source of truth as the build string.
  All fixes verified in a real browser against the real data from this run; no regressions found against the existing synthetic-fixture test suite for the schema editor, the unnumbered-shloka flagging, or the manifest check.
- **Convert tool (v0.30.1): Proofread prompt now explicitly handles a real, observed OCR artifact — verse-number markers ("॥ N ॥") landing after the wrong shloka.** Root cause: when verse numbers print in their own visual column/margin, Vision can read that whole column as one layout block and splice it back in slightly offset from the actual verse it belongs to (seen directly on page 110 of this same source — confirmed via Tesseract's cleaner line-by-line reading of the same page for comparison). The existing OCR-side "reading order reconstruction" checkbox is a partial, opt-in, per-run answer to this; added a stronger, always-on complement instead: `PROOFREAD_PROMPT` in `gemini.js` now explicitly tells Gemini this failure mode exists and to use the markers' own strict +1 sequence plus where each verse's sense/grammar/metre naturally completes to reattach a misplaced marker to its real shloka boundary — using semantic understanding (which Gemini has and pure OCR word-geometry doesn't) rather than trusting exact OCR line order for markers specifically. Existing "review"/"unresolved" classification safety net is explicitly told to flag any marker reattachment it does, so a human still gets a chance to check it. Verified the new instruction text is actually included in the request Gemini receives (a real-browser test intercepting the outgoing prompt); verifying whether Gemini's real output actually improves on this specific failure mode needs the project lead's next live run to observe.

- **Update (fresh OCR of pages 101-220 supplied by the project lead, with exact per-sarga boundary shlokas from their reference edition): the raw OCR itself is clean and complete for sargas 9-16 — the corruption is downstream of OCR, not in it, and the source book hands us an independent ground truth for free.** Every page in this range carries a running header ("अथ &lt;ordinal&gt; सर्गः" on the first page of a sarga, the bare ordinal+सर्गः on every page after, a full "इति श्रीमत्-कवि-कुल-...-विरचिते ... आनन्दाङ्किते &lt;ordinal&gt; सर्गः" colophon on the last) — confirmed by scanning all 120 pages' OCR text directly, not inferred. Better still, the colophon block on each sarga's last page is followed by a printed running cumulative shloka count — "[आदितः श्लोकाः - &lt;previous total&gt;+&lt;this sarga's count&gt;=&lt;new total&gt;]" — e.g. page 109 reads "४४१+५५=४९६" (sarga 9 = 55 shlokas), page 121 reads "४९६+५६=५५२" (sarga 10 = 56), page 139 reads "५५२+७७=६२९" (sarga 11 = 77, as actually printed in this edition — the project lead's reference separately shows a 78th verse this print omits, to be inserted manually with a cascading renumber). This is an authoritative, independent per-sarga shloka count straight from the source, not a guess. Page ranges found: sarga 9 = pages 101-109 (55 shlokas, already pushed correctly), sarga 10 = 110-121 (56), sarga 11 = 124-139 (77 printed / 78 per reference), sarga 12 = 140-151, sarga 13 = 152-166, sarga 14 = 167-178, sarga 15 = 179-207, sarga 16 = 208-219+. Conclusion: since OCR captured all of this cleanly, the "sarga_10 became 513 shlokas spanning 5 sargas" corruption happened during Proofread (Gemini) or the merge step, not OCR — most likely candidate now built and shipped below (chunk-boundary alignment), but not proven against this exact run since the corrupted Proofread JSON itself wasn't available to diff (the project lead hit the "no proofread JSON" bug, also fixed below, while trying to retrieve it). Re-running Proofread on this same OCR data through the now-fixed pipeline (auto-split + chunk alignment) is the recommended next step — still needs the project lead's own re-run since the raw OCR lives in their upload, not this repo.
- **⚠ FLAGGED, NOT FIXED — the just-pushed "sarga_10" (513 shlokas, commit `608d0aa`) is not actually one sarga.** Found while renaming its catalog title for consistency (that rename IS done — cosmetic only, content untouched). Two pieces of hard evidence: (1) its own text contains a colophon reading "...आनन्दाङ्कित <strong>एकादशः सर्गः</strong>" (11th sarga) partway through, at shloka key 135, and a chapter-opening "अथ <strong>पञ्चदशः सर्गः</strong>" (15th sarga begins) later, at key 315 — meaning this one file spans at least sargas 10 through 15, concatenated, not a real "sarga 10"; (2) the actual `smv10.*.mp3` audio files only go up to `smv10.56.mp3` (~56-58 tracks, consistent with a single real sarga's length, matching sargas 1-8's actual 52-59 range) — nowhere near 513, confirming the audio side never expected a sarga this long either. Checked further: no colophon/chapter-marker was found anywhere between keys 136-314 (where sargas 12, 13, and 14's own boundaries should be) — meaning even the INTERNAL markers needed to reliably split this file don't fully survive in the pushed text, so this isn't a simple "just split at the colophons" fix; some boundaries may have been lost during OCR/Proofread itself (e.g. a colophon landing right at a chunk boundary). Not touched beyond the title — splitting this correctly needs either the project lead's guidance on where the real sarga boundaries are, or (following the same reliable path used for sargas 1-8) the raw source text for sargas 9-16 supplied directly for a clean re-ingestion that bypasses this pipeline's apparent boundary-loss issue entirely.
  Update: the auto-split detector below (`sarga-detect.js`) reproduces this exact analysis automatically — run against this file's own text it independently confirms the same three segments (keys 1–135 → ambiguous "10_to_11", 136–314 → ambiguous "12_to_14", 315–513 → confident sarga 15). It does NOT retroactively fix this already-pushed file by itself (it only runs at a fresh Push time, and the middle segment's exact boundary is still genuinely unrecoverable from this text alone) — still needs the project lead's call on sargas 9-16's real boundaries, or the raw source text re-run through Convert, either of which the tool will now split correctly going forward.

- **Convert tool (v0.28.0): auto-detect + auto-split sarga boundaries — per the project lead's explicit choice ("Detect + auto-split silently"), no confirm screen.** Directly fixes the class of mistake that produced the "sarga_10" entry flagged above. New `sarga-detect.js` (`window.DGE.SargaDetect`) scans a completed Proofread run's merged text for two real printed-kavya conventions — chapter-opening "अथ &lt;ordinal&gt; सर्गः" and closing colophon "इति ... &lt;ordinal&gt; सर्गः" (Sanskrit ordinal words 1–30) — and classifies each stretch between markers as either a *confident* single sarga number (both surrounding markers agree, or a trailing stretch with nothing to contradict the running number) or an honest, unconfirmed *range* label like `12_to_14` when they don't — deliberately conservative, since the whole point is to stop producing confidently-wrong labels, not swap in a different kind. Wired into `buildSchemaPreview()`/`pushToGithub()` in `app.js`: the ordinary single-sarga case (no markers, or one clean match) is completely unchanged; a multi-sarga batch instead renders one independently-editable schema block per detected segment (auto-derived slug/title per segment, e.g. `sarga_10` → `sarga_10_to_11` + `sarga_12`), logs exactly what was detected/split (visible in the Log panel, not literally silent — just not a blocking screen), and Push sends every segment's file plus one `library.json` update together as a single commit. Verified with a 5-case unit-test suite (including the real pushed `sarga_10` data, which reproduces the exact three-segment breakdown documented in the flagged entry above) and a full real-browser Playwright run driving the actual Upload→OCR→Proofread→Build Schema→Push flow with Vision/Gemini/GitHub mocked: confirmed 2 editable blocks render for a 2-marker batch, a per-segment text edit survives into the pushed blob content, the commit contains exactly N grantha files + library.json, and — regression check — a clean no-marker batch still renders exactly 1 block and pushes exactly 1 grantha file, byte-for-byte the old behavior.

- **Convert tool (v0.29.0): three fixes from a direct project-lead report of the Sumadhva Vijaya sargas 10-16 run — a real data-loss-shaped bug, a durability gap, and a boundary-hallucination mitigation.**
  1. *Fixed a real bug: Proofread's merged result looked lost after a tab reload even though nothing actually was.* `runProofread()` only ever built the in-memory `finalJson` at the END of a fresh run — the per-chunk data was safely saved to IndexedDB the whole time, but the merge step itself was never redone until the Proofread button was clicked again. A reload (the same tab-eviction behavior documented above) wiped `finalJson` but not the saved chunks, so the status bar correctly showed "19/19 chunks" while Download/View/Push all threw "No proofread JSON yet — run Proofread first" — exactly the error the project lead hit and asked "was it stored in cache ever?" about. It was, in full. Fix: pulled the merge logic into a shared `mergeSavedProofreadChunks()` and call it automatically the moment a file with a fully-saved proofread result is reselected — no click needed, no network call, pure free recomputation from already-saved data. Verified in a real browser: run OCR+Proofread to completion, reload the page, reselect the same file, confirm `finalJson` is restored and the exact "run Proofread first" error no longer appears, with zero clicks on Proofread.
  2. *New: raw OCR/Proofread backup to GitHub, per the project lead's direct ask ("there should be some foolproof way to capture this data... else we risk running OCR and proofread all again").* Until a finished grantha is pushed, OCR pages and Proofread chunks live only in the browser's IndexedDB — a cleared cache, a new device, or storage eviction before that point genuinely does lose them (unlike case 1 above, which was recoverable; this covers the cases that aren't). New `backupRawDataToGithub()` pushes the raw, unprocessed data for the current file to `dge/convert/backups/<sanitized file key>/{ocr,proofread}.json` in one commit — deliberately outside the Library catalog, never read by the reader app, a pure safety copy. Fires automatically (silently) after every OCR pass and every completed/paused Proofread run whenever a GitHub token is already pasted; also a manual "☁ Backup this file's raw data now" button in the Upload tab for backing up sooner or after adding a token later. Verified in a real browser: auto-backup fires after OCR (ocr.json only) and again after Proofread (adds proofread.json, containing the real chunk data), and the manual button produces the identical commit content on demand.
  3. *New: chunk boundaries can no longer straddle a chapter marker, default on.* Investigated whether Proofread's fixed-size chunking (default 8 pages/request) could be handing Gemini a chunk containing BOTH the tail of one sarga and the head of the next — a real, generic risk for cross-boundary confusion in any chaptered text, and a plausible (not confirmed — the actual corrupted Proofread JSON for the reported sarga_10 run wasn't recoverable to diff against) contributor to that corruption. New `buildAlignedChunks()` reuses `sarga-detect.js`'s own marker-detection against raw OCR page text and forces an early chunk cut whenever a page opens a new chapter, capped at the configured chunk size — a chunk can only end up SMALLER at a boundary, never larger, and a run with no detected markers produces byte-for-byte the same chunks as before. New "Align chunk boundaries to chapter markers" checkbox in the Proofread tab, default checked. Verified in a real browser with a 10-page run (chunk size 3, a marker planted at page 5): with the option off, the chunk covering pages 4-6 straddled the boundary as expected (the bug this fixes); with it on, page 4 became its own forced 1-page chunk and page 5 started a fresh one — confirmed via the actual Gemini request bodies sent, not just internal state.
  All three verified together with the full existing test suite (auto-split, reload-recovery, backup, chunk-alignment) — no regressions.

- **Convert tool (v0.30.2): fixed a second gap in the same reload-recovery logic from item 1 above — the "known files" quick-resume button skipped it entirely.** The project lead hit this directly on the Sumadhva Vijaya sargas 10-13 run: file status bar correctly showed "Proofread 8/8 chunk(s)" (OCR 57/220, 163 pending), yet Build Schema Preview threw "⚠ No proofread JSON yet — run Proofread first." Root cause: `onFileSelected()` (re-picking the actual file via the file input) already had the correct completeness check and called `mergeSavedProofreadChunks()` to rebuild `finalJson` for free — but `resumeFromKnownFile()` (tapping a `.known-file-btn` in the known-files hint panel, the *other* way to resume without re-selecting the file) never had the same check, so it always showed the generic "tapping Proofread will resume from where it left off" note and left `finalJson` null even when every chunk was already saved. Fix: mirrored the exact same `isComplete` check + `mergeSavedProofreadChunks()` call into `resumeFromKnownFile()`. Verified in a real (headless) browser: seeded IndexedDB with a complete 2/2-chunk saved proofread result reachable only via the known-files hint, reloaded, clicked the known-file button, confirmed the resume note read "2/2 proofread chunk(s) already saved for this file — restored automatically, nothing to re-run" and Build Schema Preview succeeded with no "No proofread JSON yet" error. Immediate workaround for anyone hitting the old bug before this ships to their device: re-select the file directly via the normal file picker instead of the known-files quick-resume button — that path already worked correctly.

- **Convert tool (v0.30.3): auto-populate grantha title/author from a populated sibling — direct project-lead ask ("shouldn't title etc be auto populated? I don't have to give grantha title every time for each new sarga").** Picking a target slug (via search, the folder browser, or its "suggested next segment" button) that ends in a number and has a populated sibling under the same parent path (e.g. picking `kavya_alankara/sumadhva_vijaya/sarga_10` when `sarga_9` is already populated) now auto-fills: **title**, by swapping the sibling's own trailing number for the new one (`"Sumadhva Vijaya सर्गः 9"` → `"...सर्गः 10"`) — keeps whatever chapter-word the sibling actually used (सर्गः, स्कन्धः, काण्डः, ...) instead of assuming one, so it works for any multi-part work, not just सर्गः-numbered kavyas; **author**, by fetching the sibling's own already-pushed `data.json` from GitHub and reading `metadata.author` (a real network call, best-effort — silently does nothing on failure/no token, never blocks picking a target). Never overwrites a value the admin actually typed — only fills a field that's still empty or still holds this code's own last guess, tracked via `lastAutoFilledTitle`/`lastAutoFilledAuthor`, so typing your own title then picking a different sibling never gets clobbered. Verified in a real browser (mocked catalog + GitHub API): title and author both auto-fill correctly from a real sibling, and a manually-typed title survives re-picking the same target unclobbered.
  **Not fixed, and flagged rather than guessed — the same run's sarga_11_to_12 "unconfirmed" merge (131 shlokas) reported alongside this ask.** `sarga-detect.js`'s auto-split (v0.28.0) correctly split off `sarga_10` (58 shlokas) and `sarga_13` (69, matching the project lead's own "13.69" reference) using real chapter-open/colophon markers, but found ZERO markers anywhere in the 11–12 span, so it honestly labeled the whole stretch a range instead of guessing a wrong split — the conservative behavior it was deliberately built to have (see the v0.28.0 entry above). This means the source text's own colophon for sarga 11's end and/or chapter-opener for sarga 12's start didn't survive OCR/Proofread as recognizable text for this specific page — a data-quality gap on that one internal boundary, not a code defect (the same detector's markers worked fine immediately before and after this span). Useful ground truth already on record from this project's own earlier per-sarga page-range investigation (see the "Update (fresh OCR of pages 101-220...)" entry above): sarga 11 = 77 shlokas, sarga 12 = 54 — **77+54 = 131, an exact match** for this merged block's count, strong (not proven) evidence the real cut is exactly 77 shlokas in. Immediate workaround: the auto-split's per-segment schema-preview textareas are independently editable before Push (existing, unrelated behavior) — the merged block's text can be manually cut at its 77th shloka into two segments before pushing. A generic fix (recognizing this source's own printed running cumulative-shloka-count colophon — "आदितः श्लोकाः-N+M=N+M" — as a THIRD anchor type, independent of the named-ordinal markers) is plausible but not built: it would need verifying against this run's actual proofread text to confirm Gemini's output still carries that exact marker, which isn't available from this session (lives only in the project lead's browser).
  **Update (v0.31.0) — the manual editor the workaround above needed now actually exists, per the project lead's own detailed spec.** Their exact ask, in full: delete a shloka with auto-renumbering; type a target number and have a shloka relocate there with everything else auto-sorting; insert a manual sarga-boundary between any two shlokas (with the next one restarting local numbering at 1, and an editable closing-colophon field); a quick-jump search instead of scrolling a long list; and (separately) get Gemini itself to flag suspected split-shloka/boundary issues instead of only catching them after the fact. All built:
  1. **Real bug found and fixed along the way, independent of the editor itself**: a split-off segment (e.g. the auto-detected "sarga 11" block) kept the BATCH's global running shloka index instead of restarting at 1 — exactly what the project lead caught directly ("Ekadasha sarga should have started with one. Instead it is showing as 59"). `MapperMod().buildGranthaJson` keys shlokas by `index`, and `buildSchemaPreview()`'s per-segment slice never remapped that field after slicing. Fixed: each segment's shlokas are renumbered 1..N locally before mapping, matching the LOCAL per-sarga numbering convention every other sarga in this project already uses.
  2. **Per-row toolbar** (`renderer.js`, delegated click handlers so it survives rows being added/removed): move up/down, "move to position #" (type a target number, the row relocates there, everything renumbers), "+ shloka" (insert a blank row right after, for a verse the OCR/print genuinely omitted — e.g. the already-flagged sarga 11 verse 59 gap), "✕ delete" (blocked below 1 remaining row, so a segment can't collapse to an empty file), and "✂ split sarga after this" (see below). A row's number is never separately stored — it's always recomputed from its live DOM position, so any of these operations "just works" with no separate bookkeeping to keep in sync.
  3. **"Split sarga after this shloka"** — the manual complement to `sarga-detect.js`'s automatic detection, for exactly the sarga_11_to_12 case above: cuts a segment's row list at that point into two independently-editable blocks (bootstrapping an ordinary single-file batch into the same multi-segment machinery on its very first split, so there's only one code path). The new segment's number/slug/title are auto-suggested as "previous + 1" — but ONLY when that number isn't already claimed by another segment in the same batch; caught this colliding with a real already-existing next segment during testing (splitting "sarga 10" when "sarga 11" already followed it produced two blocks both auto-titled "सर्गः 11") and fixed it to fall back to an obviously-unfinished label ("...(split — rename me)") instead of a silently wrong duplicate. Every segment's title AND path are now plain editable text inputs (previously static text) for exactly this reason — auto-derived numbers are a starting guess, not a guarantee.
  4. **Closing colophon field**, per segment, wired to the existing `metadata.colophon` convention (already used by `kavya_alankara/sumadhva_vijaya/sarga_1..8`, confirmed by reading one of those files directly) — optional, stored separately from whatever's already in the last shloka's own text, with a `suggestColophon()` helper in `sarga-detect.js` that offers a sibling/previous segment's own colophon text with just its ordinal word swapped, when one's available, rather than fabricating lineage/authorship wording this code has no way to know.
  5. **Quick-jump search bar** above the whole preview area (`#schemaJumpBar`) — searches Sanskrit + commentary text across every segment at once, Enter/click cycles matches, scrolls to and briefly highlights the matched row.
  6. **Gemini-side detection, the project lead's direct ask ("isn't there any way that Gemini AI recognizes this discrepancy")**: added rule 10 to `PROOFREAD_PROMPT` (`gemini.js`) — explicitly tells Gemini to watch for an incomplete/garbled chapter-opening or closing-colophon line, or a verse that looks like it was wrongly split into two shlokas (or two merged into one) beyond what the existing verse-marker-reattachment rule already resolves, and to set `classification: "review"` with a specific note when either looks likely — surfaced through the existing review-classifier UI a human already checks, not a new UI.
  Verified all of the above in a real (headless) browser end-to-end, including the caught-and-fixed collision case: local renumbering after auto-split, delete/insert/move-up/move-to-position all correctly renumbering, split-after both bootstrapping a plain single batch and splitting an already-multi one, the colophon field landing in the actual committed JSON (intercepted the real GitHub blob-creation request bodies, not just DOM state), and the jump bar finding/highlighting the right row.
  **Not built, explicitly out of scope for this pass**: true multi-select-and-bulk-move (the per-row ▲/▼ plus "move to position #" covers the same outcome one row at a time, which is what got built); auto-extracting an existing embedded colophon out of a shloka's own text into the new separate field (the field is purely additive — nothing already in a shloka's text is touched or duplicated); the cumulative-shloka-count auto-detection third anchor type flagged in the entry directly above (still unverified against real data, unrelated to this manual-editor ask specifically).
  **Also caught and fixed while shipping this: a real cache-staleness bug of exactly the kind `PENDING.md`'s own "Known unresolved bugs" section warns about.** The v0.31.0 commit bumped `DGE_CONVERT_VERSION`/the CSS cache-bust query string but missed `app.js?v=` — so the version banner would have claimed 0.31.0 while some browsers kept serving the OLD app.js under the stale `?v=0.30.3` URL, silently NOT getting any of that release's fixes. Caught by re-checking all four cache-bust points together before this release, not by a user report — worth double-checking all of `DGE_CONVERT_VERSION`/`DGE_CONVERT_BUILD`/`app.js?v=`/`style.css?v=` move together every time, not just the ones that were actually touched.
  **Update (v0.32.0) — the project lead's next ask, built together as planned: (1) the schema-editor's edits now survive a reload, and (2) a "chapter manifest" ground-truth check.**
  1. **Schema-edit persistence.** Before this, every delete/move/insert/split/colophon/title edit in the schema preview lived only in the DOM — a reload (the same tab-eviction failure mode already fixed for OCR/Proofread progress, see the v0.29.0 entry above) would have silently discarded all of it, even though the underlying Proofread data survived fine. `saveSchemaEditState()` now re-collects the LIVE, current state (via the same `collectEditedShlokas()` the row editor already uses) into IndexedDB after every Build Schema Preview, every row-level edit (`renderer.js` now dispatches a bubbling `dge-schema-changed` event on any structural change or textarea input, debounced 800ms before writing), every title/slug/colophon edit, and every manual split. `resumeFromKnownFile()`/`onFileSelected()` now restore it automatically on file resume, right alongside the existing Proofread-completeness restore — no extra click, no re-running Build Schema Preview.
  2. **Chapter/sarga manifest** — the project lead's exact spec: how many chapters/sub-chapters, how many shlokas each, first/last few words of each chapter's opening/closing shloka, and its closing colophon — entered as ground truth BEFORE checking the output, then validated automatically against whatever's actually built (and re-validated live after every edit, not just once). New collapsible "Chapter/sarga manifest" section above the schema preview; each row is `{label, expected shloka count, opening words, closing words, colophon}`; matched to the actual built/split segments by position and checked with lenient (whitespace/danda-normalized, substring-near-start/near-end) text matching, since OCR output won't be byte-identical to hand-typed expectations. Renders one clear banner: a green "✅ N/N chapters match" or specific red flags ("expected 4 shloka(s), found 3", "opening doesn't match manifest..."). Persisted and restored the same way as the schema-edit state, for the same reload-survival reason.
  **Real bug caught and fixed while building/testing this, not shipped broken**: the manifest check's first implementation read `seg.mappedJson.shlokas` directly — a snapshot object that's only ever updated by the title/slug/colophon input handlers, never by row-level delete/move/insert (those only ever touch the DOM). It would have silently never noticed a row being deleted or moved. Fixed to re-derive the live shloka list from the DOM the same way the save function already does, for both the manifest check and (implicitly, since it shares the fix) anything else that needs "what does this segment actually contain right now."
  Verified all of the above together in a real browser: a clean manifest match, a live count-mismatch flag immediately after deleting a row (no rebuild needed), a live closing-text mismatch after inserting a blank row, and — the actual point of building this — a full page reload followed by known-files resume correctly restoring both the exact edited shloka list (including the mid-test blank insert) and the manifest itself, with the check immediately re-confirming the same (correctly still-flagged) mismatch state.

- **Confirmed clean from a fresh OCR upload, cross-checked against the project lead's own reference-edition boundary shlokas: raw OCR is NOT the source of the sarga_10-16 corruption.** See the "Update" note attached to the FLAGGED sarga_10 entry above for the full per-sarga page ranges and the source's own printed running-cumulative-shloka-count discovery (an independent ground truth for exact per-sarga shloka counts, straight from the book). Still needs: the project lead to re-run Proofread on this same OCR data through the now-fixed pipeline (items 1-3 directly above), and a decision on how to handle sarga 11's one verse (59) that this print physically omits but the reference edition includes.

- **Convert tool (v0.26.0–0.27.0): root-caused and fixed the "OCR says choose a file again after backgrounding the tab" report, plus batched Vision OCR calls (real speedup, project lead's own suggestion).**
  1. *Root cause, explained to the project lead and now explained in-app*: nothing was actually lost. Two SEPARATE browser behaviors were conflated in the report — (a) a backgrounded tab's JS pauses immediately (recoverable, just wait); (b) after several minutes away, mobile browsers can go further and evict the whole tab's memory, wiping the live PDF file object (not recoverable — no web page can prevent this, it's the same security boundary that stops any site reading files without the user re-picking them each time). OCR needs the live file to render more page images and hits this; Proofread doesn't (it only reads already-saved OCR text from IndexedDB), which is exactly why the project lead's own account showed Proofread's "resume from where you left off" working smoothly while OCR's did not. The old error, "Load a PDF or image(s) first," was technically correct but read like data loss. Replaced with `describeFileReselectNeeded()` in `app.js`: names the specific file and exact page progress when there's exactly one candidate (from `currentFileDisplayName` or the single entry in the known-files list), stays generically reassuring rather than guessing when there are multiple known files and no resume click yet (verified this exact ambiguous case with a real test — my first attempt at the fix wrongly named one of several candidates, caught and fixed before shipping). Also rewrote the Upload tab's warning hint to explain both mechanisms explicitly. This is the real, permanent fix available within a pure client-side tool — the underlying tab-eviction behavior itself cannot be prevented from a web page, full stop; only the confusion around recovering from it could be fixed, and now is.
  2. *Batched Vision OCR calls — the project lead's own suggestion ("more than one page at once, like 5, instead of one after another") — implemented for the "Vision AI only" engine.* Added `ocrImagesBatch()` in `vision.js`: Vision's `images:annotate` endpoint already accepts multiple images in one HTTP call, each returning its own independent result, so this is a real cut in network round-trips over a large book (not a change to Vision's own per-image OCR speed or cost). New "Pages per Vision API call" field in the OCR tab, default 5, persisted like every other option; set to 1 to fall back to the original one-call-per-page behavior. Deliberately conservative on failure: one bad page fails the WHOLE batch as a unit (same halt-and-resume-after semantics the tool already relied on, just a coarser unit) rather than trying to salvage partial results — kept it simple and safe rather than clever. Not applied to "Tesseract.js only" (no network call to batch — it's local WASM work) or "Both" (the per-page Vision+Tesseract cross-check would only get more complicated for no matching benefit) — confirmed via diff that neither of those code paths was touched at all, purely additive. Verified thoroughly in a real browser with a mocked Vision endpoint: a 12-page run at batch size 4 made exactly 3 HTTP calls (not 12) with correct per-page results; a simulated batch-2 failure correctly halted after exhausting retries, kept pages 1–4 saved, and reported the right page range; reloading the page (simulating the real tab-eviction scenario) and re-selecting the file correctly showed "Resume OCR from page 5?" — exactly the batch boundary — and resuming completed cleanly with no duplicates.

  **(a) Decided, not yet built — GitHub Actions unattended-processing pipeline.** Project lead's answer: "Both, as a choice in Convert" — a hardened client-side path AND a GitHub Actions path, selectable within Convert, not one instead of the other. Explicitly paused mid-build ("wait") before implementation started; the decision stands, just deferred. Planned approach so far, matching this repo's existing conventions (`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`, `importers/`): Python, `workflow_dispatch` inputs mirroring Convert's own fields, PR-based via `peter-evans/create-pull-request` (not a direct push — same as `ingest.yml`), `VISION_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEY` as GitHub Secrets (confirmed safe — this repo is public, workflow would be owner-triggered, Secrets are masked in logs and withheld from fork PRs), Vision-only for v1 (Tesseract stays browser-only), a Convert-UI trigger button as a deferred follow-up phase. Not started — resume once the project lead says to continue.
  **(b) Still open, not yet decided:** whether to build automatic OCR→Proofread pipeline overlap (Proofread currently CAN be run manually while OCR is still going — nothing blocks clicking both buttons — but it only proofreads whatever's in the in-memory OCR list at the moment it's clicked, not automatically as new pages keep finishing).
  **(c) From the same follow-up message, still open (not yet built):** cancel/pause and live-vs-snapshot config-read behavior during a run were explained to the project lead, not code changes (Cancel already IS pause — nothing destructive, everything saved incrementally; model/context-anchor/max-tokens fields already apply live to the next chunk; chunk-size/OCR-batch-size need Cancel→change→Resume, which already works). Actual open builds: (1) show Gemini's real per-model max output token limit next to the model picker (`listModels()` in `gemini.js` already fetches `outputTokenLimit` from `models.list` but discards it); (2) adaptive/recommended chunk-size or page-count suggestions before/during a run; (3) ~~auto-populate grantha title/author when the chosen target slug is a sibling of an already-populated multi-part work~~ — done, see v0.30.3 entry below; (4) folder-naming-convention audit/enforcement for new targets; (5) "Accept all" bulk action in the Review tab (only per-shloka Accept/Edit/Mark-unresolved exist today); (6) scroll-to-top/scroll-to-bottom quick-nav for long Review/Push previews; (7) make the Log panel persistently visible/pinned/floatable/minimizable instead of only reachable via its own tab. Schema-preview textareas being editable before push was confirmed already true, no change needed.

- **Sumadhva Vijaya: Sargas 1–8 ingested (441 shlokas), following the project lead's own ingestion spec — direct raw-text upload, not through Convert.** The project lead supplied a full raw Sanskrit transcript (`sumadhva_vijaya_sargas_18_full.txt`) plus a companion spec document describing the target schema and requested a validation report. Parsed programmatically (not by hand, to make the reported counts trustworthy) — split on the `## अथ ... सर्गः` headings, separated each sarga's colophon (kept, not counted as a shloka, stored as `metadata.colophon`) from its verse blocks, matched each block's trailing danda-delimited number marker, normalized digits (including a few genuinely mixed-script markers in the source itself, e.g. "३0", "२8", "५0" — Devanagari digit + ASCII digit in the same marker — handled correctly, not misread). Result exactly matches the spec's own index table and the cumulative totals baked into the source's own colophons (e.g. "आदितः श्लोकाः-१०९+५६=१६५" after sarga 3): **55+54+56+54+52+57+59+54 = 441**, zero duplicate keys, zero missing numbers, zero malformed blocks. 4 records flagged with `[ ]` (uncertain/missing source characters, sarga 6 key 34; sarga 8 keys 19/27/33) — preserved exactly as supplied per the spec's own instruction ("keep uncertain/missing characters... exactly as supplied... flag them for a later editorial-review layer"), not silently fixed or guessed at. Pushed as `kavya_alankara/sumadhva_vijaya/sarga_1` through `sarga_8` (same flat-shlokas-dict schema as the existing sarga_9, LOCAL per-sarga numbering matching the printed marker, `commentaries: {}` since this source has none). Verified in a real browser: every sarga fetches with the right shloka count and number range, the actual reader renders sarga 3's text correctly (spot-checked against the source verbatim), and the Library tree now shows all 9 sargas as distinct clickable entries.

  **Along the way, also renamed all 9 catalog titles for consistency** (`Sumadhva Vijaya सर्गः 1` … `सर्गः 9`, matching the exact `"<work> स्कन्धः N"` pattern already used by Bhagavata Purana's skandhas) — the pre-existing sarga_9 entry's title was just bare "Sumadhva Vijaya" with no sarga number, which would have shown as 9 identical, indistinguishable leaf labels in the Library tree once sargas 1–8 were added alongside it (confirmed this was a real risk by reading `library.js`'s tree-render code — leaf labels come straight from the catalog `title` field with no other disambiguator). Only `library.json`'s title and `sarga_9/data.json`'s own `metadata.title` were touched — its shlokas/numbering were left exactly as they already were.

  **Retracts part of an earlier flag in this file**: previously guessed that the pre-existing sarga_9 (verses 15–55, from an earlier separate Convert/OCR job, source unknown) might actually be mislabeled Sarga 1 content, since 15–55 exactly matches the tail of Sarga 1's real range. Now that the real Sarga 1 text is available, checked directly — sarga_9's actual text ("प्राज्ञ-वित्तमयमाप्तुमागतैः...", about a scholarly assembly/debate) does **not** match Sarga 1 verse 15 at all ("गोभिः समानन्दित-रूपसीतः...", about Hanuman crossing the ocean). That hypothesis is disproven. What sarga_9 actually is remains unconfirmed either way — it doesn't match anything now supplied (only sargas 1–8), so it can't be checked against the real Sarga 9 until that text is supplied too. Left as-is; not blocking anything.

  **Also wired up audio for all 9 sargas** (the other half of the project lead's ask, "map audios"). Confirmed the existing `smv<sarga>.<verse_no>.mp3` filenames in `assets/` already use the exact same per-sarga LOCAL verse numbering as the shloka keys just ingested — spot-checked `smv1.1.mp3`, `smv1.30.mp3`, `smv1.55.mp3`, `smv3.1.mp3`, `smv3.56.mp3`, `smv8.1.mp3`, `smv8.54.mp3` all actually exist, a direct 1:1 match with no renaming or re-mapping needed. Set each sarga's `metadata.archiveBaseUrl` = `"data/kavya/sumadhva_vijaya/assets/"` (relative, same-origin — the files are already committed straight into this repo, not a separate CDN/repo, so this matches how every other same-repo asset is already fetched), `filePrefix` = `"smv<N>."`, `fileExtension` = `".mp3"` — the app's existing `resolveAudioSrc()` (`js/audio.js`) already builds a URL as `base + filePrefix + id + extension` for whichever shloka's playing, so no new code was needed, only the 3 metadata fields per sarga. Verified in a real browser: every constructed URL fetches with HTTP 200 and `audio/mpeg` content-type across multiple sargas and edge verses (first/last/mixed-digit-marker verses), the on-page track counter correctly reads e.g. "2/55" after selecting a shloka in sarga 1 (not the 43 left over from the default stotra — that "0/43" seen before any shloka is clicked is a pre-existing static placeholder baked into `index.html` itself, present for every grantha until the first click, unrelated to this change). Sarga 9's audio was already correctly wired from the earlier push and was left untouched. Not covered: the sarga-opening announcement clips (`smv<n>.0.mp3`), Sarga 1's four intro tracks (`smv1.0a`–`0d.mp3`), and closing colophon clips (`smv<n>.end.mp3`, `end2.mp3` for sarga 16) — the app has no per-sarga "intro/outro audio" slot today, so these aren't reachable through the per-shloka player; logging as a possible future feature, not fixing now.

- **Convert tool: two more requested improvements built (v0.25.0) — auto-detected starting shloka number, and an always-visible file status dashboard.** Both direct follow-ups from the project lead's feedback on the numbering fix:
  1. *Auto-detect the starting number instead of always defaulting to 1 or requiring manual entry.* The project lead's exact ask: "why should shloka number always be hardcoded to fifteen... you should be looking at the shloka numbers found in that particular page... or you can optionally ask where should the number begin from, default is one." Added `U().detectVerseNumber(text)` in `utils.js` — scans the first merged shloka's own OCR'd text for the LAST danda-delimited marker (॥, | or ‖ on both sides) whose inner content is digits-only in one script, converts Devanagari/Kannada/Telugu/Tamil/Malayalam/Bengali/ASCII digits to a plain integer, and rejects compound markers like "१.४४" (contains a non-digit '.') rather than guessing at a chapter.verse split. Wired into `runProofread()`'s completion: if a marker is found, the "Starting shloka/unit number" field is auto-filled with a visible hint explaining where the number came from; a value the admin already typed is never silently overwritten (tracked via `lastAutoFilledStartingNumber`, cleared whenever a different file loads or its proofread data is cleared). Verified with real Devanagari/Kannada/ASCII text and a battery of tricky cases (no marker, compound rejected, last-of-multiple-markers, user-override survives) in a real browser — all correct.
  2. *Always-visible file status: pages loaded/OCR'd/proofread/pending, sarga/target, without having to hunt through tabs or re-select the file.* The project lead's exact ask: "how do I know how many pages... are loaded, how many proofread, how many OCRed... it must all be very clear on top of the convert tool page itself... if I again pick up the same file, it should show me that sarga name, shloka numbers which are loaded, etc." Added `#fileStatusBar` — same "outside every tab, never hidden" placement as the error box (so status is visible no matter which tab is open) — showing the filename, `OCR: X/Y page(s) — N pending`, `Proofread: X/Y chunk(s) — N pending — M shloka(s), numbered A–B` (upgrading to the actually-built schema's real numbered range once "Build Schema Preview" has run, since that reflects any starting-number offset), and the chosen target grantha path. Wired into `renderFileStatusBar()`, called after every OCR page, every Proofread chunk, schema build, push, and — critically for the "re-picking the same file" case — at the end of `onFileSelected`/`resumeFromKnownFile`/`handleUrlImport`. Found and fixed a real bug of my own while building this: `currentMappedJson` (the built schema) was never reset when switching files or clearing progress, which would have shown a previous file's stale numbered range in the new status bar — added the reset alongside every existing `finalJson = null` site. Verified in a real browser: hidden with no file loaded, populates correctly on resume with the exact pending counts, updates live through a full OCR→Proofread→Build flow, and correctly resets to a clean state when switching to a different file (no leftover numbers from the previous one).

- **RESOLVED (v1 shipped) — Grantha content editor**, greenlit and built this
  session. Project lead's exact ask, resolved via `AskUserQuestion`: "Both
  — inline for quick text fixes, popup for structural changes." Built as
  `dge/js/content-editor.js`, wired into the main reading page (not
  Convert):
  - An `✏️ Edit` toggle appears in the grantha header, gated on
    `is-authorized` (admin) OR `is_superadmin` (project lead's exact
    words: "admin, super admin" — both tiers, not superadmin-only like
    Convert's own gate) AND the grantha actually being safe to edit (see
    below). Toggling it on shows a pencil icon per shloka.
  - **Inline edit**: tapping the pencil turns that shloka's text into a
    textarea in place with Save/Cancel, matching the "editable there
    itself" half of the ask.
  - **Structural edit**: a `🔀 Reorder / Insert / Delete` button opens a
    popup modal — one row per shloka with move-up/down, insert-after,
    delete controls, renumbering sequentially from the grantha's own
    existing starting number on Apply (mirrors Convert's schema editor's
    row model, matching the "similar to our previous schema editing"
    ask; drag-and-drop specifically not built — up/down arrows achieve
    the identical reordering outcome and are far more reliable to test).
  - **Safety**: neither edit mode touches GitHub until a floating "Preview
    & Save…" bar is explicitly tapped, showing the exact file path and
    new shloka count before pushing — reuses `admin-editor.js`'s existing
    `dgeAdminBatchCommit` (the same safe diff-and-skip-unchanged-files
    commit path Config Editor already uses), so no new GitHub
    infrastructure was needed at all.
  - **Real, deliberate scope boundary, not an oversight**: only grantha
    files whose source `data.json` is the plain legacy `{metadata,
    shlokas:{n:{...}}}` shape are editable — confirmed via a new
    `window.stotraDataEditable` flag set in `core.js` from the RAW
    fetched JSON, before `dgeNormalizeGranthaData()` overwrites it.
    Granthas that need that normalization to even render (`items:[...]`
    schemas — Vedic texts, itihasa_purana_text's per-chapter nesting)
    don't get an Edit button at all, since saving them back would need
    real denormalization logic that doesn't exist yet and risks
    corrupting the source file's actual on-disk shape. Sumadhva Vijaya
    (all of it) and most kavyas/stotras ARE covered by this.
  - Bumped `index.html`'s `dge-html-version` meta tag + `core.js`'s
    `DGE_EXPECTED_HTML_VERSION` together to `4.61.1` (the stale-shell
    detector both must agree on), plus `render.js`/`core.js`/the new
    file's own `?v=` cache-bust tags.
  - **Verified end-to-end in a real browser** against the just-published
    live `sarga_10` data (56 real shlokas): Edit toggle appears for an
    authorized session and not otherwise; inline edit stages a change and
    surfaces the save bar; structural modal opens with all 56 rows,
    insert/move-down both work and the row count updates correctly;
    Apply renumbers and updates the live shloka count; the save-preview
    modal shows the correct real target path
    (`dge/data/kavya/sumadhva_vijaya/sarga_10/data.json`) and shloka
    count. Deliberately did NOT click through to an actual push during
    this test (no real edit was intended) — the commit path itself is
    the same already-proven `dgeAdminBatchCommit` Config Editor uses, not
    new/unverified code.
  - **Not built / real remaining gaps, for whenever this comes up again**:
    denormalization for `items:[...]`-schema granthas (would unlock
    editing for a large chunk of the corpus currently excluded); editing
    the `commentaries` sub-object itself (currently only `sa` is
    editable inline; the structural editor preserves whatever
    commentaries a row already had but doesn't let you change them);
    pagination for very large shloka sets in the structural modal (an
    100+ verse sarga renders every row at once — functional but a long
    scroll, no perf problem found in testing but not stress-tested
    beyond ~56 rows either).

- **RESOLVED — taxonomy decision: `guru_charitre` category is retired;
  all "Vijaya" hagiography/mahakavya works fold into `kavya/` alongside
  Raghuvamsha/Kumarasambhava/etc.** The project lead's call, in response
  to the mis-filed Sumadhva Vijaya push flagged below: these are all
  kavyas/mahakavyas, so a separate biography-vs-composed-by-an-acharya
  category isn't wanted — one `kavya/` category for all of them. Carried
  out: `dge/data/guru_charitre/sumadhva_vijaya/` (1,041 audio files +
  README + rename_manifest.json + source_audio_mapping.json) moved whole
  to `dge/data/kavya/sumadhva_vijaya/` via `git mv` (renames, not
  delete+recreate, so history is preserved); the mis-filed
  `kavya_alankara/raghavendra_vijaya/sarga_9/data.json` moved to
  `kavya_alankara/sumadhva_vijaya/sarga_9/data.json` (see below); `library.json`'s
  catalog entry path updated to match; `taxonomy.json`'s `guru_charitre`
  block removed and `sumadhva_vijaya` added as a sibling of
  raghuvamsha/kumarasambhava/etc. under `kavya` instead. Checked
  `library.json` and every JS file under `js/`/`convert/` for other
  `guru_charitre`/`raghavendra_vijaya` references first — none exist (the
  audio was never wired into the live app yet, and no other catalog entry
  used either path), so this was a pure rename with nothing else to
  update. `taxonomy.json` isn't fetched by the live app or Convert at
  runtime (confirmed by grep) — it's a reference/planning document only,
  so this edit is documentation-accuracy, not a functional change.
  `PROJECT_STATUS.md`'s original entry documenting the now-superseded
  `guru_charitre` decision was left as-is (it's a dated historical record
  of what was decided at the time, not a live spec) — this note is the
  correction.

- **RESOLVED — the mis-filed "Sumadhva Vijaya" push (commit `0ad82fd`,
  originally at `kavya_alankara/raghavendra_vijaya/sarga_9`) is now at
  `kavya_alankara/sumadhva_vijaya/sarga_9/data.json`, alongside its own audio.**
  Was flagged, not yet fixed, as of the previous note in this file;
  folded into the taxonomy move above once the project lead confirmed
  `kavya/` as the destination. Also fixed the numbering bug (see the
  Convert fix below) IN this already-pushed file, not just prospectively
  for future pushes: checked every one of its 41 shlokas' own embedded
  verse marker (॥१५॥ … ॥५५॥) against its stored dict key — all 41 were
  consistently exactly +14 off, zero anomalies — so this wasn't a guess,
  the file's own content proved the correct offset. Re-keyed "1"–"41" to
  "15"–"55" directly (`metadata.totalShlokas` unaffected, still 41).
  Verified with a fresh fetch in a real browser after the fix. One thing
  still NOT independently verified (the project lead didn't address this
  part, and I have no way to check it myself): whether "sarga 9" is
  actually the correct sarga number for these verses against Sumadhva
  Vijaya's real 16-sarga structure — that number was carried over as-is
  from what was typed during the original push. Low risk to fix later if
  wrong (a plain rename), but worth a glance before pushing sarga 8 or 10
  alongside it.

- **Convert tool: schema-build numbering now has a "Starting shloka/unit
  number" field (v0.23.0) — fixes exactly the bug that produced the
  mislabeled push above.** Real bug, confirmed and reproduced: OCR/Proofread
  scoped to a page selection starting partway through a work (e.g. the
  "SumadhvaVijayaMoola.pdf" run that started at the page printed with
  ॥१५॥) always got keyed 1, 2, 3… in the pushed schema regardless of
  which real verse the batch actually started at — `runProofread()`'s
  merge step (`let seq = 1`) assigns a fresh 1-based sequential `index`
  to every run, with no way to tell it "this run continues from unit 15,
  not unit 1." Root-caused by reading `mapper.js` (keys shlokas by
  `s.index`) and `app.js`'s merge loop directly — the embedded canonical
  verse numbers (॥१५॥, ॥१६॥…) inside the OCR'd `sa` text were correct all
  along; only the dictionary KEY used to store each shloka was wrong.
  Added a plain numeric field on the Push tab, next to Grantha
  title/author: leave it blank (default 1) for a batch that starts at the
  work's first unit, or set it to the real starting number for a partial
  batch — "Build Schema Preview" then keys the shlokas starting from that
  number instead of always restarting at 1. Reproduced the exact reported
  bug and verified the fix in a real browser (seeded a synthetic partial
  proofread run starting at page 15 — without the field, the preview
  showed "Shloka 1"/"Shloka 2"; with it set to 15, it correctly showed
  "Shloka 15"/"Shloka 16"). Also added a line to the push-success message
  explaining that GitHub Pages can take a minute or two to redeploy, since
  the project lead asked "should I refresh or do something?" after not
  immediately seeing a just-pushed grantha in the Library — checked
  `js/core.js`'s `library.json`/grantha `data.json` fetches, both already
  use `cache:'no-store'` plus a cache-busting timestamp, so the app itself
  isn't caching anything stale; the delay was GitHub Pages' own
  build/deploy latency, not fixable from this side, just worth explaining
  instead of leaving it as a mystery.

- **Convert tool: revamped the whole page into a horizontal tab/wizard
  layout (v0.22.0), replacing the single long vertical scroll through
  every stage at once.** Seven tabs — ⚙️ Setup, 1. Upload, 2. OCR,
  3. Proofread, 4. Review, 5. Push, 📋 Log — each showing only its own
  small area below the tab bar; tabs are always directly clickable (jump
  to any stage), and a "Next →" / "← Back" button pair at the bottom of
  each panel supports the linear step-through most sessions actually
  follow, matching the "move next next next... until the entire process
  is complete" request. The tab bar scrolls horizontally and is sticky at
  the top of the viewport, since 7 tabs don't all fit on a ~393px phone
  screen (every screenshot from this project so far has been on a phone).
  The last-opened tab is remembered (localStorage) so a reload/reopen
  doesn't dump you back at Setup. Folded the "Danger zone" fieldset into
  the Upload tab (it's about managing the currently-loaded file, so it
  belongs next to Upload rather than sitting alone at the very bottom).
  The error box stays outside all tab panels, always visible regardless
  of which tab is open, since a background OCR/Proofread run can fail
  while you're looking at a different tab. This was a pure layout/CSS/JS
  change — no element IDs were touched, no business logic in
  app.js/gemini.js/github.js/mapper.js was touched — so every existing
  feature (model picker, folder browser, granular clear, output modal,
  progress bars, etc.) keeps working exactly as before, just inside its
  new tab. Verified in a real headless browser: every tab shows exactly
  one active panel, Next/Back walks the full sequence forward and back
  correctly, reload restores the last tab, the folder browser and
  granular-clear features both still function correctly from inside their
  new tabs, and no console/page errors. Screenshots taken at both 393px
  (phone) and 1200px (desktop) confirm it looks intentional, not just
  functional.

- **Convert tool: "Reconstruct reading order" checkbox investigated against
  real output (gltAvivRti-01.pdf, page 11/12) — not the cause of anything
  wrong; a real finding went the other way.** The project lead asked
  whether that checkbox (checked for this run) explains a suspected bad
  reading. Checked the actual `ocr_1.json`/`ocr_2.json`/`ocr_3.json`
  (Tesseract/Vision/both) against the real page image: verse numbers land
  correctly inline (not clumped at page-end, the failure mode that
  checkbox exists to fix), and Tesseract and Vision — two independent,
  differently-built engines — agree with each other almost word-for-word.
  The one real discrepancy found was in the OPPOSITE direction: the
  project lead's own pasted "Gemini-generated ground truth" transcript of
  the same image reads "एवं सन्ततः सन्तापमवधारयन्नाह" at one spot, while
  both OCR engines (independently) AND the image itself (checked directly)
  read "एवं सन्तप्तः सन्मृतिमेवार्थयमान आह" — i.e. that one line in the
  "ground truth" comparison text looks like a Gemini image-reading slip,
  not an OCR/checkbox bug. Worth remembering generally: a single
  generative model's one-shot image reading isn't automatically more
  trustworthy than two independent OCR engines agreeing with each other —
  worth checking both ways before assuming which one is wrong.

- **Convert tool: schema-building pipeline (`mapper.js`) audited end to
  end, per the project lead's concern that "if it goes wrong, everything
  goes wrong because we are directly writing it to GitHub."** Traced the
  full path: Gemini's per-chunk `number` field restarts at 1 in every
  chunk (expected, chunks have no memory of each other) — `app.js`'s merge
  step already assigns a separate guaranteed-unique, guaranteed-ordered
  `index` field across the whole merged result, and `mapper.js` correctly
  keys the final schema by `index` (not the repeating `number`). Confirmed
  against a real live grantha (`data/stotras/pns/data.json`) that this
  matches the established, working schema convention exactly (plain
  sequential "1","2","3"... keys, canonical verse numbers like "॥ १.४४॥"
  living inside the `sa` text itself, not a separate field) — not a bug,
  by design, and consistent with everything else already live. Also
  confirmed there's a real human checkpoint already in place before
  anything reaches GitHub: `renderSchemaMapEditable()` renders every
  shloka's Sanskrit/commentary in editable textareas, and `pushToGithubBtn`
  reads back the (possibly-edited) DOM state, not the original unedited
  mapper output — nothing pushes without a chance to fix it first. No
  correctness bug found in this pass; noting the audit happened and what
  it covered, per the "check what's being extracted and how it's being
  converted" request, rather than just asserting it's fine.

- **Convert tool: a real follow-up round of usability fixes, all reported
  from actually using the tool on Raghavendra Vijaya + SumadhvaVijayaMoola:**
  - **"Clear saved progress" was one all-or-nothing button with no
    indication of WHICH file it would act on** — confirmed by reading the
    actual code that it was correctly scoped to the current file only
    (not the wider wipe it looked like), but the confirm dialog never
    named the file, which is a real source of the "did it just delete
    everything?" feeling when juggling multiple files in one session. Now
    granular: separate checkboxes for OCR text / proofread results /
    reset-options-to-default, and the Danger Zone always shows which file
    it's about to act on by name before you click anything.
  - **Retrying a deterministic failure (MAX_TOKENS, bad key, permission,
    model missing, bad request, blocked) 3-4 times before giving up was
    pure wasted waiting** — the exact same request fails the exact same
    way every time; only a setting change fixes it, not a delay. These
    now fail on the first attempt with a clear "not retrying automatically"
    message. Quota/network/overload errors still retry as before (those
    genuinely can clear with time).
  - **Cancel didn't take effect until the current retry's FULL backoff
    delay finished** — confirmed the retry loop only checked for
    cancellation between attempts, never during the wait itself, so
    Cancel during a 45s backoff meant waiting the full 45s regardless.
    Fixed by polling the cancel flag every 250ms during any wait instead
    of sleeping through it blind.
  - **OCR/Proofread progress was a single line of text with no bar and no
    time estimate** — added a real `<progress>` bar plus a rough ETA
    (from the actual average time-per-unit so far THIS run, not a guess,
    and correctly excluding anything already done in an earlier resumed
    session so resuming doesn't produce a nonsense estimate) to both
    stages, each with its own separate status line so OCR and Proofread
    status never overwrite each other (they silently shared one element
    before). OCR's line also now names which engine is actually running
    (Vision / Tesseract / both).
  - **The folder browser's "Add new" prompt still felt like guessing** —
    added real convention detection: if the existing siblings at a level
    already form an obvious numbered series (`sarga_01`, `sarga_02`, ...),
    the next one is pre-filled automatically in the right format. Caught
    and fixed a wrong first attempt at this during testing: naming the
    "kind" being added from the parent folder's own name works for a
    category level (`kavya/` → "a new kavya", correct) but is actively
    wrong one level deeper (`kavya_alankara/raghuvamsha/` → children are text
    layers like `mula`, not more "raghuvamsha"s) — since telling those
    two cases apart reliably isn't possible from names alone, the
    non-numeric case now stays generic and lets the real sibling list
    speak for itself instead of guessing a label that can be wrong.
  - **"Run OCR (from page 1)" had a confusing parenthetical** — simplified
    to "Run OCR" (a separate "Resume" button/bar already exists for
    continuing).
  - **General visual polish** — the page used browser-default styling
    throughout; restyled to the same warm palette as the rest of DGE's
    admin pages (card-style sections, consistent rounded inputs/buttons,
    primary-action buttons visually distinct from secondary ones) so it
    doesn't feel like a separate, rougher tool from the rest of the
    project. Not a full redesign — flagging that a dedicated UX pass is
    still a reasonable future ask if the project lead wants one.
  All verified in a real headless browser: granular clear correctly
  preserves the unchecked category and removes only the checked one;
  the non-retryable-kind list and the abortable-sleep function are both
  present and wired in; the folder browser's numbered-series detector
  round-trips correctly (`sarga_01`→`sarga_02`, `skandha_01..12`→`skandha_13`,
  mixed/non-numeric siblings → no guess); the previously-wrong
  "raghuvamsha" mislabel is gone; new styling actually renders (primary
  button color, warm body background) with no console errors.

- **Convert tool: added a folder browser for picking the push target
  path** (step 5, "📁 Browse existing folders…"), triggered by a real
  question: adding Sarga 1 of a new 10-sarga mahakavya (Raghavendra
  Vijaya), what should Sarga 2's path be? Investigated the real catalog
  before answering rather than guessing: `dge/data/library.json` already
  has 4 real mahakavyas at `kavya_alankara/<name>/mula/data.json`, and (separately)
  large multi-part works like Bhagavata Purana use one catalog entry per
  part (`purana/bhagavata_purana/skandha_01`, `skandha_02`, …) — the
  second pattern is what actually works with Convert's current schema
  (flat, one grantha per push, each able to carry its own commentary
  layer later) without any code change, so the answer given was
  `kavya_alankara/raghavendra_vijaya/sarga_01`, `sarga_02`, etc., not the
  capitalized, un-suffixed `Kavya/RaghavendraVijaya` about to be typed in
  the screenshot. Also traced `github.js`'s actual push behavior and
  confirmed a real risk this surfaced: pushing to the SAME slug a second
  time is a straight overwrite (skipped only if byte-identical), not a
  merge — so re-using Sarga 1's exact slug for Sarga 2 would have
  silently destroyed Sarga 1's content, with only a generic "already has
  content, overwrite?" confirm as the safety net, no explanation of what
  "overwrite" actually means here. The folder browser directly addresses
  this: it shows the REAL existing siblings at whatever level you're
  adding to (built from every catalog entry, populated and unpopulated
  alike — the existing search box only searches unpopulated ones, so it
  can't show an already-populated sibling like an existing sarga_01 at
  all), with an "Add new here" field that only ever needs ONE new segment
  typed (auto-sanitized to lowercase/underscore, matching the corpus
  convention automatically) rather than a whole path retyped from memory
  each time — structurally preventing the exact mistake above rather than
  relying on remembering it. Verified against the real live catalog in a
  real browser: correct top-level folders and counts, drilling into
  `kavya/` shows the 4 real mahakavyas with correct populated/title
  badges, and adding a deliberately messy "Raghavendra Vijaya" at that
  level correctly sanitizes to `kavya_alankara/raghavendra_vijaya`.
  **Separately flagged, not yet decided:** the `itihasa_purana_text`
  schema (one data.json per whole work, sargas nested as `items[]`) that
  those 4 existing mahakavyas actually use has NO commentary support at
  all in `core.js`'s normalization (`commentaries: {}` hardcoded empty) —
  fine for a mula-only text, but would need a real code change if
  Raghavendra Vijaya's vṛtti/commentary is meant to be readable per-sarga
  rather than mula-only. Not resolved; flagging so it isn't silently lost
  if a commentary shows up on a future page's OCR run.

- **Fixed a real gap: `audio-admin.html` was never linked from the main
  ADMIN dropdown** — built and shipped earlier in the session, but the
  link to it in `index.html` was missed, so a superadmin had no way to
  discover the page existed at all short of typing the URL directly.
  Added `🎙️ Audio Admin` to the dropdown (`js/admin-editor.js`'s
  visibility toggle list updated too) — still routes to the page's own
  separate `AUDIOADMIN` passkey gate, unaffected by this, since the whole
  point of that page was a credential independent of `is_superadmin`.
  Also added a general **"NEW" badge mechanism** for the Admin dropdown
  (`js/modals.js`'s `markNewFeatureBadges()` + a `NEW_ADMIN_FEATURES`
  list) per the project lead's request that newly-added features be
  flagged so they don't go unnoticed sitting in a long menu — a small
  blinking pill next to a dropdown item, shown once the first time that
  menu is opened after the feature ships, then not shown again on future
  page loads (tracked in localStorage). Audio Admin is the first entry;
  add `{itemId, badgeId}` to that list for future admin-only additions.
  Verified in a real browser: badge shows on first open, persists through
  a same-session re-open until dismissed, and is gone after a reload;
  clicking through still correctly hits Audio Admin's own passkey gate.

- **Convert tool: added a "View Output" modal** (expandable/maximizable/
  minimizable/closeable, doesn't require scrolling to the bottom of a long
  page) — the project lead reported the old inline Preview section at the
  bottom of the page was the only way to see generated text, requiring a
  scroll-and-hunt every time on mobile. New `👁 View OCR Output` /
  `👁 View Proofread Output` buttons sit right next to steps 2 and 3's own
  action buttons and open the same modal directly. Verified in a real
  browser: open/maximize/restore/minimize (tapping the header while
  minimized restores it, since the minimize button itself becomes a small
  target once shrunk)/close, and switching views inside the modal with no
  data yet shows the existing error message instead of breaking. Also
  added a `📋 Copy` button in the modal header (per a follow-up report
  that the preview had no copy option at all) — copies exactly what's
  showing (raw OCR or proofread), same clipboard-with-fallback approach
  as the existing "Copy Log" button.

- **Convert tool: found and fixed the real cause of "response was cut off
  (hit the output token limit)" (MAX_TOKENS) failures, separate from the
  429/quota issue fixed earlier.** The shared `js/gemini.js` client (used
  by Convert, Ashtadhyayi, and Kosha alike) had `maxOutputTokens: 2048`
  hardcoded as its default — genuinely too low for Convert's use: a dense
  commentary chunk's full corrected Sanskrit text plus a per-shloka
  classification+note in strict JSON, for up to 8 pages at once, can
  easily need more than that, and a cut-off response breaks the JSON
  parse entirely (which is exactly the error the project lead saw on the
  densest commentary page in a run). Raised the shared default to 8192,
  and added a configurable "Max output tokens per Gemini response" field
  in Convert's Proofread section so it can be raised further per-book if
  needed, without waiting on another code change. (The project lead's
  Gemini consultation on this also suggested specific claims — a
  "Gemini 3.6 Flash" 65536-token ceiling, dropping temperature/top_p, a
  new "thinking_level" parameter — none of which could be verified from
  here and aren't things this session has confirmed are real/current API
  behavior, so none of that was adopted; only the verifiable, safe fix
  --  raising a value that was clearly too conservative -- was made.)

- **Convert tool: real Gemini 429 bug hunt + fixes, from a real failed run
  (SumadhvaVijayaMoola.pdf resumed, then GitaVivrti.pdf hit "quota
  exceeded" on Proofread after only ~80 pages despite a newly-funded
  prepaid billing account).** Root-caused and fixed several real, distinct
  issues found while investigating, not just the one reported:
  - **`convert/gemini.js` had its own hardcoded `'gemini-3.6-flash'`
    fallback, inconsistent with the shared `js/gemini.js` client's own
    real default (`gemini-2.5-flash`)** — two different hardcoded model
    names for the same purpose in the same app is a bug regardless of
    which (if either) is currently valid. Removed the duplicate; Convert
    now defers entirely to the shared client's default when no model is
    picked.
  - **Model picker is now a real dropdown backed by Gemini's own
    `models.list` API**, not a hardcoded/free-text guess — tap "Load
    available models" (needs the Gemini key filled in first) to fetch the
    live list for that exact key, cached locally so a reload doesn't
    always refetch. An "Other (type below)…" option still allows a raw
    custom name. Directly fixes "must be latest, not old ones" — it now
    always reflects reality for that key rather than a name baked into
    the code.
  - **429 (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED) is a per-minute/per-day rate window on the
    key, not the prepaid balance** — confirmed this is really how Gemini's
    API works (billing lifts the free-tier cap but doesn't remove
    time-based rate limits). Added: (a) a proactive, configurable delay
    between Proofread chunks (default 3s) so a sequence of successful
    requests doesn't itself burst past a per-minute cap; (b) the retry
    backoff now recognizes a quota-kind failure specifically and waits
    65-120s instead of the 5-45s used for a plain network blip, since a
    short retry on a per-minute cap almost always just hits the same
    window again.
  - **Added an optional "context anchor" field to Proofread** (e.g. "Bhagavad
    Gita Chapter 1, Bhavadipa commentary by Raghavendra Yati") — per the
    project lead's Gemini consultation's second suggestion, passed into
    the prompt to help Gemini resolve ambiguous OCR errors using real
    context. Blank = unchanged behavior. (Vision's `languageHints` via
    `imageContext`, the consultation's other suggestion, was already
    implemented earlier — verified nothing needed changing there.)
  - **Language-hint quick-pick chips** (Sanskrit/Kannada/Telugu/Tamil/
    Malayalam/Bengali/Hindi/English) added beside the language-hints field
    — tap to toggle a code in/out instead of having to know/look up BCP-47
    codes.
  - **The "Files with saved progress" list is now actually clickable** —
    it was pure informational text before (confirmed: the project lead
    expected clicking a filename there to resume it, it did nothing).
    Since OCR/proofread progress is looked up purely by filename+size (not
    the actual File object) and Proofread only ever reads the saved OCR
    text, tapping an entry now resumes Proofread/Review/Push directly
    without re-uploading — re-selecting the real file is only still needed
    to OCR genuinely new pages.
  All verified in a real headless browser (mocked models.list + a seeded
  IndexedDB resume scenario, since neither needs a live Gemini key to
  exercise the actual code paths): model dropdown populates and filters
  out non-generateContent models correctly, custom-model field toggles,
  language chips toggle bidirectionally with the text field, and clicking
  a saved-file entry loads its OCR data and enables Proofread with zero
  file re-selection. Convert tool version 0.16.0 → 0.17.0.

- **`dge/audio-admin.html` built (passkey `AUDIOADMIN`, own session flag,
  deliberately NOT SSO'd with the site's other admin pages) — client-side
  Web Audio port of the `Gita_Studio_Colab.ipynb` shloka-boundary
  detector, plus the vṛtta-based floors requested afterwards. Upload an
  audio file, it decodes in-browser, auto-detects boundaries from silence
  gaps (Otsu-thresholded, same algorithm as the notebook), and now
  additionally: (1) a user-adjustable **minimum shloka length** floor
  (default 10s — below this a "segment" is dropped as noise, not kept, since
  a real chanted verse's vṛtta gives it a physical minimum duration), (2) a
  user-adjustable **minimum gap** floor (default 1.5s — a detected silence
  shorter than this is treated as an in-verse breath and bridged, not kept
  as a real boundary), (3) an optional manual **dB threshold override**
  usable even with auto-detect on, since the auto-computed threshold can be
  too permissive on real (non-studio) recordings. All three are exposed
  directly in the Options section so the project lead can retune and
  re-run without needing another Claude session. Verified against a
  synthetic file with known boundaries (a 0.8s gap correctly bridged, a
  0.5s "blip" correctly dropped, two real ≥10s segments correctly kept).
  **Also verified against the real sample provided (`mangalacharana.mp3`,
  359s)** — finding to flag for the project lead: sweeping the manual dB
  override from -30 to -50 dB, and separately inspecting the raw gap
  lengths at six different thresholds (-18 to -32 dB) directly, found that
  outside the ~5s leading pre-roll before chanting starts, **no gap in this
  recording exceeds ~1.25 seconds even at a lenient -18dB threshold** — this
  particular recording has no real inter-verse silence to detect at all
  (continuous/fluent chanting style, and/or room tone or normalization
  filling any brief pause). This isn't a bug or a tuning gap in the tool —
  no silence-based threshold can split audio that doesn't contain real
  silences. Options if per-shloka splitting of this specific file is still
  wanted: re-record with brief deliberate pauses between verses, or use a
  different technique entirely (e.g. forced alignment against the known
  verse text, or manual boundary marking in the Review table — not yet
  built). ~~Still blocked on pushing anywhere: `Tribhuvanachar/bhumandala-audio-data`
  doesn't exist yet — repo creation is blocked by the same GitHub App
  permission restriction hit earlier for `bhumandala-kosha-data`
  (`403 Resource not accessible by integration`); the project lead needs to
  create it manually (empty repo is fine).~~ Resolved: the project lead
  created the repo. Ready for the project lead to actually test the page
  end-to-end against the real repo now (upload → process → review → push);
  not yet done from this side since it needs the project lead's own scoped
  GitHub token, not something to test with a shared/synthetic one.
  **Follow-up round, answering "where does the audio go / can I download it /
  why does GitHub reject files over 25MB":** (1) added a destination-folder
  default, auto-filled from the uploaded filename (slugified) the first time
  a file is picked, still freely editable — GitHub has no separate
  "create folder" step, any new path just gets created on push; (2) added
  Download for every clip (per-row ⬇), plus "Download all (.zip)" (a small
  hand-rolled store-only ZIP writer, no external library) and
  "Download JSON only" — all work with no GitHub token/repo involved, so
  they're also the fallback when a file is too big to push; (3) switched the
  GitHub push from the Contents API (one small base64 PUT per file — this
  is what was hitting the 25MB-ish ceiling) to the Git Data API
  (blob → tree → commit → ref, all files in one atomic commit), which
  reliably handles files close to GitHub's real ~100MB per-file limit and
  isn't affected by the website's drag-and-drop uploader's separate 25MB
  cap at all. Verified: the whole blob/tree/commit/ref sequence (including
  the empty-repo bootstrap path, since `bhumandala-audio-data` doesn't
  exist yet) against a local mock of the GitHub API — correct call
  sequence, correct fallback to creating the ref when none exists yet.
  **Still an open question, not yet built:** Google Drive as a storage
  target was asked about — a static page can't act as a bridge to the
  project lead's personal Drive without a Google Cloud OAuth client set up
  on their end first (one-time task only they can do); not built until
  they decide if that's worth it over Download + manual placement.

- **`Gita_Studio_Colab.ipynb` uploaded — a genuinely new tool, nothing to
  reconcile against.** Checked: no prior notebook, script, or doc anywhere
  in the repo does anything like this (only existing `.ipynb` is the Kosha
  importer) — unlike the Tīrtha/Ashtadhyayi zips, this isn't a duplicate of
  already-live work. What it does: BS-Roformer vocal separation (optional
  2nd pass) on an uploaded chanting recording, then auto-detects each
  shloka's boundary from the silence gaps (Otsu-thresholded per-recording,
  no manual tuning needed), and exports **either or both** of (a) a
  `shlokas.json` timestamp map (`{id, start, end}` in both seconds and ms)
  against the *whole, uncut* audio file, or (b) individual per-shloka
  clips — the project lead's stated target being the "Bhagwadgeeta/
  Vachanamrut" seek-based playback architecture (single audio file + JSON
  map, player does `audio.currentTime = start`) rather than one-file-per-verse.
  **Directly relevant to an existing open item above**: this is exactly the
  kind of tool that could resolve the VedaVaNi Rigveda per-Sukta-not-per-Rik
  gap, IF real per-rik silence gaps exist in the downloaded Sukta audio
  (untested — the notebook was verified by its author only on a synthetic
  file with known boundaries, not on real VedaVaNi audio). Not yet run
  against anything in this repo. Decide: (1) where this notebook should
  live in the repo (`veda_toolkit/`? a new `audio_toolkit/`?), (2) whether
  to actually try it against a real downloaded VedaVaNi Sukta file to see
  if it can deliver real per-Rik boundaries.

- **Two more delegated coworker deliverables uploaded, not yet checked
  against the live repo** (same pattern as Tīrtha Prabandha below —
  verification requested, in progress):
  - `dge_stream5_ashtadhyayi1.zip` — claims 3 new layers (Siddhānta-Kaumudī,
    Mahābhāṣya, Vasu), a pada-cheda/anvaya panel, and a new
    `ashtadhyayi-admin.html`. **Spot-checked already: all 7 layers' `data.json`
    files (kashika, siddhanta_kaumudi, mahabhashya_patanjali, balamanorama,
    tattvabodhini, nyasa, vasu — 3.4 to 21.6 MB each, real content) and
    `dge/ashtadhyayi-admin.html` already exist live on `main`** — this looks
    like the SAME situation as Tīrtha Prabandha: the delegated session's work
    (or equivalent) is already merged, and this zip may be entirely
    redundant. NOT yet verified: the pada-cheda/anvaya reader panel itself,
    and whether the live admin page's layer count/licence badges actually
    match the zip's claims exactly.
  - `dge_stream3_guruparampara_dropin1.zip` — claims a 10-figure Dāsa
    Paramparā lineage (210→215 nodes), a Brindavana-image curation registry
    (no images embedded, by the delegated session's own admission — couldn't
    reach Wikimedia from its sandbox), and `holy-places-admin.html` seeding
    135 places with a documented export shape for the Tīrtha nearest-finder.
    **Not checked at all yet** — node count, whether `holy-places-admin.html`
    already differs from what's live, whether 135 places overlaps/conflicts
    with Tīrtha Prabandha's 95.
  - **The `?` big picture**: at least 2 of 3 delegated-session deliverables
    checked so far turned out to be full or partial duplicates of work
    already live, because those sessions didn't have the live repo mounted.
    Worth deciding whether future delegated tasks should require pulling
    `main` first (Stream 3's own task update says it did this — "I pulled
    your live `bhumandala` repo to match its exact conventions" — and its
    findings are correspondingly more likely to be genuinely additive).

- **Tīrtha Prabandha — likely duplicate build, needs reconciliation.** A
  separate delegated coworker session (task update pasted 2026-08-10)
  built a *second*, self-contained Tīrtha Prabandha bundle
  (`dge_tirtha_prabandha_bundle1.zip` — `tirtha.html`, `dge/js/geo-finder.js`,
  `dge/tirtha_admin.html`, 39 kshetras, Wikipedia thumbnails, nearest-holy-place
  finder, admin completeness tracker) — built *without* that session having
  the repo mounted, so it doesn't know that `dge/tirtha/` **already exists
  live** with 95 holy places (see PROJECT_STATUS.md "Tīrtha Prabandha —
  ✅ live"). Before merging anything from the new bundle: compare the two,
  decide what (if anything) from the new bundle is genuinely additive
  (the nearest-holy-place finder and the Wikipedia-thumbnail fetch look
  like real net-new features; the 39-kshetra dataset itself is very
  likely a smaller duplicate of the existing 95-place one). Verification
  requested by the project lead, in progress as of this entry — see
  chat for the specific check-list once it's sent.
- Revoke the exposed GitHub PAT (flagged at the top of PROJECT_STATUS.md).
- Decide on the repo-splitting proposal (PROJECT_STATUS.md, "Repo size /
  restructuring proposal").
- Run the full Kosha import (Colab notebook + the 2.3 GB `dict.zip`) and
  upload the result — full corpus build already exists in
  `bhumandala-kosha-data` and has been run once; this item is about the
  *original* local dictionary collection being fully accounted for.
- Resolve Ashtadhyayi commentary licensing (`licence: verify` — confirm
  with the source curator or replace/remove).
- Decide how far to take the Kosha "Unclear"-licensed dictionaries
  (currently included per case-by-case authorization with attribution —
  confirm this stands, or narrow to the cleared Cologne core).
- **VedaVaNi audio — final storage decision.** Currently only exists as
  GitHub Actions workflow artifacts (14-day expiry) — Rigveda (both
  pāṭhas, all 10 maṇḍalas, 947 MB) and Yajurveda Aranyaka (8 tracks,
  399 MB) have been pulled and verified against the live server, but
  nothing has a permanent home yet. Stated plan is to move this to
  archive.org rather than commit it into `bhumandala` directly — needs
  the project lead to actually do that upload (or say if the plan's
  changed) before these artifacts expire.
- **SuMadhva Vijaya text** — still not found despite two upload attempts
  (`smv-assets-text.zip`, `smvassetstext2.zip` — neither contained the
  actual verse text; audio is fully done and correctly renamed). Waiting
  on the project lead for a proper source, or confirmation to keep this
  paused indefinitely.
- **Convert tool — OCR degrading on later pages of a source PDF**
  ("legacy font/legacy encoding" per the project lead's own Gemini app).
  The 9-page sample already sent (SMV pages 101–109) all OCR'd fine —
  can't reproduce the reported degradation without the actual later
  pages that failed. Needs those specific pages (or the full PDF).

## Pending on this session / next Claude session

- **Gold-Standard Commentary Contract (v2.2) — the renderer itself built, 25 Aug ("right away").** Direct follow-up to the same day's gap analysis and the layout-vs-theme/badge design correction (see `dge/GOLD_STANDARD_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full plan this implements — Parts A/B/D). A commentary shaped to the contract now actually renders with pratīka↔word-pill bidirectional linking, provenance boxes, and the certificate wrapper + badge, completely additively — nothing about legacy plain-string commentary changed.
  - **`dge/js/gold-render.js` (new)**, mirroring `footnote-engine.js`'s own additive-module shape (`window.DGEGoldRender.render(commentaryObj) -> {pillGridHtml, bodyHtml} | null`): splits `commentary_markdown` on blank lines and dispatches each block by its leading token (`#`/`##`/`###` title banners, `> [!मङ्गलम्]`, `> [!प्रमाणम् (cite)]` with a citation-chip footer, `> [!फलितार्थः]`, `*अवतरणिका —*` transitions, `---` colophons, default paragraph); links every `**"pratika"**` span to its `word_mappings` entry by exact string parity (the contract's own "Parity Rule"), assigning each *occurrence* its own span id so a repeated pratika string doesn't produce duplicate DOM ids, while every occurrence still jumps to the same shared word-pill; binds every daṇḍa to its preceding syllable with a non-breaking space (Part D1 of the contract) — a real, independent typography fix worth having regardless of Gold-Standard adoption, since the legacy plain-string path still has no equivalent binding.
  - **`render.js`'s commentary-block loop branches on `commentaries[cKey].format === 'gold_v2_2'`**: a Gold-Standard commentary is kept as an object (not run through `applyTransliteration`, which expects a string — it displays in its authored Devanagari only for now, a stated scope limit, not an oversight) and rendered via `DGEGoldRender.render()` into a `.commentary-block.dge-gold-wrapper`; search-term highlighting (`highlightText()`) still runs over the result, so in-page search matches still highlight inside Gold-Standard content exactly as they do for legacy commentary. Everything else in the loop (tab bar when multiple commentaries are selected, the popup checklist, `dgeToggleCommentarySelection`) needed zero changes.
  - **The badge is a real control, not decorative** (per the project lead's direct ask: "so that the user knows that the content is rich and the view can be switched"): `window.dgeToggleGoldSimple()` (gold-render.js) toggles `.dge-gold-simple` on the wrapper, and `main.css` folds the pill grid and every provenance box's special framing back to plain paragraph flow when that class is present — a CSS-only view switch, no second render pass, so it can't drift out of sync with the underlying data. Pratīka links and daṇḍa binding stay intact in both states; only the boxed/pilled presentation toggles.
  - **Verified against real content, not synthetic test data throughout**: `dge/js/test-gold-render.js` (new, plain Node, matching `test-search-resilience.js`/`test-parity.js`'s established pattern) embeds three real units from the project lead's own Gītā-Vivṛtti sample (Adhyāya 2), chosen specifically for the trickiest cases found by inspection — `BG_2.1` has a pratīka (`"कुतः"`) with genuinely no matching `word_mappings` entry, a real parity gap in the sample data itself, proving the graceful-fallback path (renders as plain bold text, doesn't crash) without needing invented broken data; `BG_2.12` has two sequential `[!प्रमाणम्]` blocks back to back, one spanning multiple verse lines; `BG_2.37`'s अवतरणिका opens with a **curly-single-quoted** emphasis span the contract's own syntax rules say must NOT be linked as a pratīka (only straight-double-quoted `**"..."**` counts) — confirmed it renders as plain emphasis, not a broken or false link. 18 assertions, all passing.
  - **Live end-to-end verification in a real headless Chromium session**, not just the Node-level parser test: routed a real fetch of `PrahladaKrutaNarasimha/data.json` through Playwright with one Gold-Standard commentary object injected, confirmed the full pipeline — wrapper renders, badge shows the correct label, all 3 word-mapping pills and 3 linked pratīkas render, the unmapped pratīka correctly falls back, प्रमाणम्/फलितार्थः/अवतरणिका blocks all render, clicking a pill scrolls to and pulses its matching pratīka span, clicking the badge toggles the simplified view (pill grid hides) and back — and, as a regression check, confirmed a legacy plain-string commentary on the very same shloka renders exactly as before with no `.dge-gold-wrapper` leaking onto it.
  - **A real integration bug caught and fixed while wiring this up, not shipped**: `render.js`'s commentary-loop originally ran `applyTransliteration(cText, activeScript)` unconditionally over every commentary value — fine for a string, but a Gold-Standard commentary is now an object, so this needed an explicit branch before touching it at all, threaded through both the transliteration step and the two separate search-matching code paths (`scope === 'all'` and `scope === '<specific-cKey>'`), each of which also assumed a string.
  - **A real Playwright test-harness gotcha hit while verifying, not an app bug**: the injected fake `data.json` never showed up in the live page at first — `core.js`'s `fetchGranthaData()` always appends a cache-busting `?t=<timestamp>` query param, and the test's route pattern (`**/data/.../data.json`, no trailing wildcard) only matched a URL ending exactly at `.json`, so the *real* file kept being served underneath the route. Fixed by adding a trailing `**` to the glob.
  - **Deliberately not attempted in this pass**: `tools/validate_gold_standard.py` (the V1–V7 CI gate enforcement, Part C of the architecture doc) — the renderer degrades gracefully on a parity violation today (falls back to plain bold text, confirmed above), but nothing yet *rejects* bad content before it ships; transliterating Gold-Standard commentary to non-Devanagari scripts; compound hyphenation logic (turned out to need none — the contract's examples show hyphens already literal in the authored `commentary_markdown` text, not something render.js computes); actually ingesting the Gītā-Vivṛtti sample as a real grantha in the library (taxonomy placement, `library.json` regeneration) — this pass proves the renderer against real content via injection, not a live catalog entry.
  - Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend addition, no Python surface touched — `test-gold-render.js` is plain Node, run directly, same convention as this session's other JS tests).

- **`dge/ashtadhyayi.html` decluttered, closing out the reading-page redesign from earlier this session, 24 Aug.** That earlier pass explicitly deferred this page ("a much more heavily loaded header/navigation... scoped as its own separate pass"). The project lead's report named it directly: "the Ashtadhyayi page... Kaumudi navigation, Ashtadhyayi navigation, Panini navigation, upper navigation, lot of unwanted stuff appearing." A live screenshot confirmed it precisely: on a 390px phone, the header alone wrapped across 3-4 rows (Read/Compare toggle, a 6-script selector, font +/-, theme, gear — six always-visible controls), and the hero card opened with THREE separate prev/next-style navigation rows stacked on top of each other (a pinned "nav-top," the Ashtadhyayi-order cluster's own prev/next, the Kaumudi-order cluster's own prev/next) before the sutra's own text ever appeared.
  - **Investigated the actual wiring before touching anything** (an Explore agent traced every handler): `#dge-prevBtnTop`/`#dge-nextBtnTop` (nav-top) and the bottom `#dge-prevBtn`/`#dge-nextBtn` are literally identical duplicate handlers, both calling `goNav(dir)` — nav-top exists purely for scroll position (pinned below the header so a reader doesn't have to scroll past open commentary layers to find Previous/Next), a real, worth-keeping reason, so it stayed. The dualnav's own `.dn-arrow` buttons, by contrast, were a genuinely redundant 3rd/4th stepping control (`stepOrder()`, functionally parallel to `goNav()`, not just a mode-switch) — confirmed safe to remove, since the two `.dn-label` mode-switch buttons don't depend on the arrows existing.
  - **Header**: `#dge-modeSeg` (Read/Compare), `#dge-scriptSeg` (6 scripts), `#dge-fontDn`/`#dge-fontUp`, `#dge-themeBtn`, `#dge-gear` — all settings a reader sets once and rarely revisits per-sutra, not per-sutra actions — moved wholesale (same ids, zero click-handler changes needed) into a new `#dge-menuDrawer`, opened by one new `☰` `#dge-menuBtn`. Reused this file's OWN existing `.drawer`/`.backdrop` bottom-sheet system (already powering the AI tutor drawer) rather than importing index.html's separate drawer-right pattern — this page already had its own established minimal-chrome mechanism, just not applied to these controls yet. The header now holds only the brand and the jump-to-sutra input (constant, primary navigation) plus the one menu button.
  - **Dualnav**: `renderDualNav()`'s `.dn-arrow` buttons (and their `ak-prev`/`ak-next`/`sk-prev`/`sk-next` click-delegation cases) removed, leaving only the two `.dn-label` mode-switch buttons and the chapters button; `stepOrder()` (now unreferenced) deleted rather than left as dead code; `.dn-label`'s CSS lost the left/right borders that used to separate it from its now-gone flanking arrows, so each cluster reads as one clean pill instead of a bordered strip. Stepping itself is completely unaffected — nav-top/nav still call the same `goNav()`/`go()`/`goKaumudi()` this always did.
  - **Search access, previously missing on this page entirely once the FAB was removed site-wide** (see the reading-page-chrome entry above, which removed `global-search.js`'s floating trigger everywhere, not just on `index.html`): a new "🔍 Search the corpus" row inside the same menu drawer calls `window.DGEGlobalSearch.open()` directly, so this page didn't lose a working feature as a side effect of that unrelated fix.
  - Verified live in a real headless Chromium session: the header shows exactly one button; the dualnav shows 0 arrow buttons / 2 labels / 1 chapters button; opening the menu drawer surfaces every relocated control; switching script from inside the drawer still works (verified against a real IAST switch); tapping "Search the corpus" closes the drawer and opens the real global-search overlay; tapping nav-top's Next button still steps to the next sutra (1.1.1 → 1.1.2) confirming the identical-duplicate nav wiring survived untouched. Zero JS console errors. Also synced this page's `dge-search.js`/`global-search.js` cache-bust versions, which had drifted stale relative to `index.html`'s. Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Adi Shankaracharya's Prasthanatrayi bhāṣya corpus imported — `darshana/vedanta/advaita/shankara_bhashya/**` (24 Aug), and a real transliteration-corruption bug caught and fixed before it shipped.** Asked to import the Shankaracharya bhāṣya corpus alongside a Rāmānuja source. `importers/shankara_bhashya.py` (already deployed, blocked earlier only by GRETIL's network block, not a permission question) fetches Brahmasutra Bhashya + six Upanishad bhāṣyas (Isha, Prashna, Mandukya+Gauḍapāda Kārikā, Taittiriya, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka) + Aitareya + Gita Bhashya from GRETIL corpustei/Zenodo — GRETIL turned out reachable from this session, so the run went direct rather than via the GitHub Actions workaround.
  - **First run (opened as PR #138) shipped GRETIL editorial prose as if it were Sanskrit.** Checked the actual written `data.json` content directly rather than trusting a clean CI run — found English GRETIL page-header/editorial text ("...GRETIL version has been converted... TEI encoding by mass conversion...", "Sanskrit corpus Text Īśa-Upaniṣad... with the commentary ascribed to Śaṃkara") transliterated character-by-character into nonsense Devanagari, because the existing junk filter only checked the first 120 characters of each unit and this aside sits mid-document.
  - **Second, independently-found bug, same importer**: a *different* GRETIL quirk — inline structural section markers glued into the middle of a unit's body, with real Sanskrit on both sides in the same string. Two shapes, found by direct inspection of freshly-fetched source text: divider-punctuation runs with an attached label (`____ START MandUp 1`, `____ BhG 13`) in mandukya/brahmasutra_bhashya/gita_bhashya, and a bare `start <ref> <num>` label dropped at nearly every verse boundary with no divider at all (544 occurrences in chandogya alone) in prashna/aitareya/chandogya/brihadaranyaka. Neither shape was caught by the first fix.
  - **Both fixed in `importers/shankara_bhashya.py`** (`HEADER_JUNK` now strips to the last match rather than dropping the whole unit; `STRUCTURAL_DIVIDER`/`INLINE_START_LABEL`/`BARE_DIVIDER_RUN`/`EDITORIAL_NOTE` strip the second class in place). Verified directly against freshly re-fetched source for all 9 works (4,486 units) before trusting it: 0 residual divider/label/editorial-note leaks, 0 English-stopword flags, 0 units silently dropped — including ruling out false positives like the genuine Sanskrit vocative particle *are* (bṛhadāraṇyaka's Maitreyī dialogue) and genuine Sanskrit bracket section-headings (brahmasutra_bhashya), which a cruder filter would have wrongly eaten.
  - Re-ran the corrected importer directly (not via GitHub Actions — GRETIL was reachable), committed straight to `claude/copyleft-licensing-dg-zmk9ac`, ran `tools/validate_data.py` (0 errors) + `tools/register_layers.py` + `tools/gen_library_status.py` per the project's own post-import convention, and closed PR #138 as superseded rather than merging the buggy content or trying to reuse/rebase its branch against a different base.
  - Kena/Katha/Mundaka bhāṣyas remain genuinely unavailable (not in GRETIL's corpus at all, confirmed in the importer's own header comment) — left as a follow-up needing the sanskritdocuments.org ITX path wired in.
  - **The Rāmānuja half of the same ask, now done as Phase 1 (24 Aug) — `darshana/vedanta/vishishtadvaita/ramanuja_bhashya/**`, 711 units.** `importers/ramanuja_mula.py` clones `github.com/vishvasa/ramanujiyam` (branch `content` — the Hugo site's own source tree; anonymous git read works from this sandbox even where the GitHub API doesn't) and imports the five works Ramanuja composed himself: Sri Bhashya (180 units), Vedanta Dipa (157), Vedanta Sara (149), Vedartha Sangraha (198, split on the source's own ~100 topical headers per file rather than left as two ~60k-character blobs), Sharanagati Gadyam (27).
    - **Deliberately narrow scope, and why.** The site's `rAmAnujaH` tree turned out to hold far more than Ramanuja's own text once actually surveyed directory-by-directory — roughly fifteen later ācāryas' sub-commentaries on the Sri Bhashya (Sudarshana Sūri's Śrutaprakāśikā, Vedānta Deśika's Adhikaraṇa Sārāvalī, Appayya Dīkṣita, Meghanādāri, etc.), translations into English/Hindi/Tamil, and — checked directly, not assumed — **at least one flatly modern, still-in-copyright work**: K.E. Devanathan's "Śrībhāṣyaprakāśaḥ" (2006, Nrisimha Priya Trust, Chennai — author, publisher and year all named in that folder's own `_index.md`). The site owner Vishwas Vasukijah's personal permission ("take what you like") is permission for what's genuinely his to give; it can't clear a living author's separate, still-live copyright on a book he merely hosts a copy of. That whole secondary-commentary layer needs a per-author copyright/date check before any of it can be imported — genuinely large (~3,700 files under `shrI-bhAShyam` alone) and left as a deliberate follow-up below, not attempted in this pass.
    - Also excluded, for a narrower reason specific to one file: `kriyA/rAmAnujaH/nitya-granthaH` (Ramanuja's daily-worship manual). Its only copy on the site interleaves Francis X. Clooney's copyrighted academic notes and the site owner's own editorial framing directly into the same file as the mula text, under explicit "विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः"/"FX Clooney - Notes" `<details>` labels — needs per-block filtering this importer doesn't yet do.
    - `shrI-bhAShyam/mUlam` turned out to carry **two parallel editions of the same Ramanuja text** on this site (`ma`/`ra`) — confirmed by direct comparison (both open "janmādyadhikaraṇam" identically) — differing only in orthography (`ra`'s transcription conflates ब/व, a South-Indian-source artifact) and whether traditional adhikaraṇārtha topic-summary headers are present. `ma` used for both reasons.
    - **Three content-quality bugs caught and fixed while building the parser**, same "verify before trust" discipline as the shankara_bhashya fix above: Markdown link syntax (`[quoted verse](url)`, two occurrences — kept the quote, dropped the URL) and the site's own `+++(gloss)+++` shortcode leaking through unstripped; an inline English critical-apparatus note on manuscript variants ("M 3 reads the following verse..."); and a scribal Tamil donor-dedication appended after Vedanta Sāra's actual colophon (past its own "śāstraṃ ca samāptam" line — cut there). Verified 0 residual artifacts across all 711 units directly against the written `data.json` files before trusting the import, not just off a clean `validate_data.py` run.
    - `library.json`/`taxonomy.json` regenerated via `tools/audit_library.py --fix` — this is a brand-new taxonomy branch (`vishishtadvaita` didn't exist before), so `register_layers.py` alone (sufficient for adding leaves under an existing branch, as with the shankara_bhashya re-run above) wasn't enough here.
    - **Phase 2, done same day (24 Aug) once the project lead said to import the secondary-commentary layer regardless — "we'll see how we can render."** `importers/ramanuja_subcommentaries.py` adds 819 more units across six works, but NOT all fifteen: each of the ~15 sub-commentary authors was individually researched (web search against archive.org records, matha lineage pages, biographical sources) before inclusion, since "import them all" can't mean importing someone else's still-live copyright along with it. That research paid for itself immediately — it caught two authors that read as classical from the name alone but are actually 20th/21st-century:
      - **"Mukkur Yatīndra"** (`44a-mukkUr-yatiH_brahma-sUtrArtha-padya-mAlikA`) is the 44th Ahobila Maṭha pontiff, **d. 1992** — in copyright, excluded. Would have been wrongly trusted as ancient without checking.
      - **"Perukkāraṇai Chakravartī"** — his *Śrī Bhāṣya Śārīraka Mīmāṃsā Bhāṣya* Vol. 1 was published in **2000** by the same publisher (Nrisimha Priya Trust) as the Devanathan 2006 book already excluded above — same category, excluded.
      - **Included, confirmed public domain**: Appayya Dīkṣita (1520–1593, *Naya Mayūkha Mālikā*, 156 units), Raṅgarāmānuja (16th/17th c., three works — *Śārīrika Śāstrārtha Dīpikā*, *Viṣaya Vākya Dīpikā*, *Bhāva Prakāśikā* — 360 units total; the last is physically filed on the site under `sudarshana-sUriH/`, attributed here to its real author per its own content, not its folder path), Sudarshana Sūri (c. 13th–14th c., *Śruta Pradīpikā*, 137 units), Vedānta Deśika (1268–1369, *Adhikaraṇa Sārāvalī*, 166 units — extracted from a source file that interleaves the root verse with two OTHER, unresearched commentators' glosses under the same `<details>` heading per verse; only the verse's own "मूलम्" layer is taken).
      - **Still excluded, each for a specific recorded reason** (see the importer's own module docstring for the full list): Uttamūr Vīrarāghavācārya (d. 1981/83, in copyright, both his own folder and his editorial apparatus nested inside Sudarshana Sūri's); Deśikāryaḥ/Lakṣmīpura Śrīnivāsa/Rājagopāla/Rāmānuja Tātāryaḥ — each either has no confirmed death date or (Rāmānuja Tātāryaḥ specifically) collides with a confirmed-modern namesake (N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya, 1928–2017) — held out on the same standard as the research itself: not confidently dated yet = not imported yet; Seneśvara's "ṭīkā" turned out to be a modern **English** exposition, not his own Sanskrit commentary at all — no genuine Sanskrit text there to take; Meghanādāri's folder turned out to hold only OCR title-page noise plus a duplicate of Ramanuja's own root text, not his distinct commentary.
      - Two content bugs caught mid-build, same discipline as everywhere else in this project: George Thibaut's (1904, PD) English SBE translation interleaved into Sudarshana Sūri's Śruta Pradīpikā source, and a recurring "is not available." OCR-gap placeholder in the Bhāva Prakāśikā source — both stripped. Verified 0 residual artifacts across all 819 units against the written files before trusting it.
      - **Still open for a later pass**: the four unconfirmed-author works above (need actual death dates, or a positive identification ruling out the modern namesake, before they can be added); Sudarshana Sūri's other major work, Śruta Prakāśikā (present on the site as two large files with no clean per-adhikaraṇa split point and self-flagged `[[TODO: aparishkRtam]]`, i.e. the source itself calls it unrefined — a parsing-effort problem, not a copyright one); the 34th Ahobila Yati's and "Kumāra Varada"'s glosses inside the Adhikaraṇa Sārāvalī file (left ungathered pending their own identification); and Nitya Grantha's Clooney-interleaved file, per-block filtering still not built.
    - **Phase 3, done same day (24 Aug): the project lead reviewed the above and said to stop gating on dates or authors' timelines entirely — "have all the content within our DG project… will take care of licenses later on, by writing personal emails and convincing if required."** That's an explicit decision on his part to take the licensing risk on personally rather than have it block the import; it does not relax the *content-quality* bar Phases 1/2 also applied. `importers/ramanuja_extended.py` adds 18 more works, 994 units: Mukkur Yatīndra, Rājagopāla, "Rāmānuja Tātāryaḥ", Deśikācārya, Devanathan (the 2006 book itself, now included), Lakṣmīpuram Śrīnivāsācārya (three works — a THIRD independent "Nyāya Kalāpa Saṅgraha", confirmed by direct comparison to be genuinely different text from Seneśvara's and "Rāmānuja Tātāryaḥ"'s same-titled works, not a duplicate), Perukkāraṇai Chakravartī (the 2000 book, now included), Seneśvara (root verses only — its "ṭīkā" is still excluded, but now for being non-Sanskrit content rather than for the date question), Sudarshana Sūri's Śruta Prakāśikā (2 units — v1/v2, no clean split point found, left as one unit apiece; a finer split is still a follow-up), Uttamūr Vīrarāghavācārya (his own prose works + his edition's introduction to Śruta Prakāśikā — his tabular apparatus, topic-index tables and errata lists, still excluded as non-prose, not for his 1981/83 death date), Vedānta Deśika's other two Adhikaraṇa Sārāvalī commentators (34th Ahobila Yati, Kumāra Varada — 166 units apiece), and Nitya Grantha (label-extracted to its own "विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः" mula layer — Clooney's notes and the site owner's separate "विश्वास-टिप्पणी" aside are still excluded, but now because they aren't Sanskrit mula text, not for Clooney's copyright specifically) plus Rāmabhadrācārya's commentary on it.
      - **Abhinava Raṅganātha's Gūḍhārtha Saṅgraha is the one work NOT imported even under this broader approval** — checked directly and found genuine OCR corruption (stray Latin letters and digits spliced into the Devanāgarī, e.g. "r 1 7 J", "IS क") that no markup-stripping regex can safely repair. A data-quality exclusion, not a copyright one — the project lead's approval covers licensing risk, not unreadable source text.
      - **Four content bugs caught building this pass**, folded into `ramanuja_mula.py`'s shared `strip_markup` (and re-verified against Phases 1/2's already-committed output afterward — unit counts unchanged, no regression): a standalone `source: [TW](url)` citation line that survived as bare "source: TW" once the URL-stripper ran; Markdown footnote syntax (`[^224]: ...`) in Devanathan's real academic apparatus; an asymmetric `+++(gloss)` shortcode in Nitya Grantha that opens but never closes; and a stray unpaired `**`/`***` left over from a source with an odd total bold-marker count. **One near-miss caught before it shipped**: the first version of that last fix also stripped single `*` characters — which turned out, on checking against already-imported text, to be the printed editions' own genuine footnote-reference markers, not junk. Narrowed to 2–3 asterisks only before committing.
      - **Two residual imperfections accepted as documented, bounded limitations** rather than chased further: a publisher's front-matter block (title page + a 1989 funding notice) at the start of Śruta Prakāśikā's v2 unit, and a stray "www" OCR-noise token in Uttamūr's Bhāṣyārtha Darpaṇa — both single occurrences inside otherwise large, valuable texts with no clean structural boundary to excise them at.
      - Total across all three phases: **2,524 vishishtadvaita units**, `tools/validate_data.py` reports 0 errors.
    - **Three follow-ups from this thread, worked same day (24 Aug).**
      1. ~~Kena/Katha/Mundaka bhāṣyas unavailable~~ **Kena done.** `run_kena()`/`parse_kena_itx()` (new, in `importers/shankara_bhashya.py`) fetches sanskritdocuments.org's `.itx` copy — a LaTeX+ITRANS file, a different source format from every other work in that importer, so it gets its own parse path rather than joining the GRETIL-oriented pipeline. Six distinct macro/artifact issues found and fixed by direct inspection (same discipline as the original HEADER_JUNK bug): `\ldq{}`/`\rdq{}` quote macros, a one-off explicit-anusvara `{\m+}` macro, `\-` hyphenation points, escaped punctuation, a `\chapter{TippaNI}` heading introducing the endnotes appendix, bare `(N)` footnote markers (kept distinct from genuine citations, which always carry text inside the parens), and the file's own closing watermark. 5 units, 0 residual artifacts. **Katha and Mundaka remain unavailable** — checked sanskritdocuments.org directly, confirmed it hosts only their root text; the only bhāṣya copies found are scanned books on archive.org needing OCR, a materially bigger job than a fetch.
      2. ~~Śruta Prakāśikā left as 2 giant blobs~~ **Finer split done — 148 units.** The source has essentially no Markdown structure (2 "### " headers total across ~3.8M characters), but does carry the original printed edition's own running page-headers — a Devanagari `१-४-३.` adhyaya-pada-sūtra reference plus a short topic phrase, recurring on nearly every page — found by inspecting a middle slice of the file directly rather than trusting the `[[TODO: aparishkRtam]]` flag as the last word. Splitting on that incidentally also solved the previously-accepted English-front-matter residual noise (item below): the whole publisher's-notice block sits before the first marker and simply falls into the discarded lead-in segment.
      3. ~~"Publisher's front-matter block… no clean structural boundary to excise them at"~~ **Resolved as a side effect of fix #2 above**, not separately.
      4. **Abhinava Raṅganātha's Gūḍhārtha Saṅgraha — searched for a clean alternative source, none found.** The site's own note attributes it only to initials "GS" and references it answering a "popular meme" — genuinely reads as a private or limited-circulation modern composition, not a widely published text with other digital copies to fall back on. The corruption pattern (stray Latin letters spliced mid-word into Devanagari) looks like a legacy Sanskrit-font encoding mismatch in Vishwas's own copy specifically, not something a different source would sidestep. Still excluded; would need the project lead's own copy or contact with "GS" directly to recover, not further searching.

- **Reading-page chrome decluttered per the project lead's direct redesign ask, 24 Aug (verbatim: "let it not sit there. Let it go into some menu item... screen should be minimal, not loaded with icons... Astadiya dot com... a protruding arrow mark or icon... when clicked, something should pop up from beneath... not stand just beneath it, trying to fight with other things").** A direct follow-up to the same day's earlier tooltip/scope-picker fix -- that pass gave the selection tooltip real clearance from the native OS toolbar, but the project lead's next message made clear a floating box was still the wrong shape of fix: a real redesign toward the minimal, sheet/drawer-based chrome ashtadhyayi.com uses, not incremental repositioning. Two pieces:
  - **`#actionTooltip` is now a real bottom sheet below 760px**, reusing the exact `.popup.popup-sheet` visual language already established for `#displayPopup`/`#commentaryPopup` (full-width, slides up from the bottom edge) instead of floating positioned near the selection -- `main.css` gained a `@media (max-width:759px)` override that does all the positioning; `ai.js` no longer computes any top/left/bottom on mobile at all, it only clears stale inline styles from a prior desktop-width run and lets the already-existing `MutationObserver` (added in the earlier pass for `body.dge-selecting`) also add `.dge-tt-show` a frame after `display:flex`, driving the CSS slide transition without touching any of the ~7 places in `ai.js` that set `tooltip.style.display`. Desktop is completely unchanged (still floats near the selection -- no native auto-popup toolbar to collide with there, and a full-width sheet would look broken at that size). Honestly noted: the hide transition is instant, not animated -- `display:none` is still set directly by the same 7 call sites, so there's no exit transition; only the entrance slides. Verified live: sheet starts off-screen (`bottom:1019px` on an 844px-tall viewport) and settles flush at the bottom edge (`bottom:844px`) after the transition, full width, `.dge-tt-show` present; desktop's tooltip stays a small (<500px) box near the selection, not full-width/bottom-docked.
  - **The two separate always-visible floating कोश/global-search circles are gone, replaced by one small edge tab.** This directly reverses an earlier pass's explicit decision (see the "Floating EDIT tab and Kosha/global-search FABs" entry further down this file, 24 Aug) to keep both as separate FABs on the reasoning that they were frequent enough to be worth the screen space -- the project lead's own direct instruction here overrides that call outright, so the reversal is intentional, not a regression. `kosha.js` and `global-search.js` no longer build a floating trigger of their own (`build()` in each no longer creates/appends/drags a FAB, and each file's injected `<style>` no longer defines one) -- both files' real, already-exported open APIs (`window.dgeOpenKosha()`, `window.DGEGlobalSearch.open()`) are completely unchanged and now the only way in. `index.html` gained one small `#dge-qa-tab` ("⋮"), docked flush to the right edge (protruding rather than floating free, echoing `content-inline.css`'s own admin EDIT-tab language) at the old midpoint between the two removed FABs, opening a new two-item `#quickActionsPopup` (`.popup.popup-sheet`, same reused component) with "📖 कोश" and "🔍 Search the Corpus." `main.css`'s `body.dge-immersive`/`body.dge-selecting` hide-the-FABs rules now target `.dge-qa-tab` instead of the two removed elements.
    - **A real bug caught during verification, not shipped**: the new tab, tapped, opened the popup and then the popup immediately closed itself again in the same click -- `modals.js`'s existing global click-away listener closes every `.popup` on any click outside `.popup-container`/`.popup`/`.top-actions`, and the new tab lived in none of those three (the working `#displayPopup` trigger button, by contrast, sits inside `.top-actions`, which is why this was never hit before). Fixed by wrapping the tab in a `.popup-container` div (matching the class the listener already exempts), not by touching the shared click-away logic itself.
  - Verified live in a real headless Chromium session: neither `#kosha-fab` nor `.dge-gs-fab` exist in the DOM any more; the new tab opens the popup, tapping "कोश" opens the real Kosha overlay and closes the popup, tapping "Search the Corpus" opens the real global-search overlay. Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).
  - **Genuinely still open, deliberately not attempted in this pass**: the equivalent declutter for `dge/ashtadhyayi.html` (a much more heavily loaded header/navigation, per the same live-testing report -- "the Ashtadhyayi page... Kaumudi navigation, Ashtadhyayi navigation, Panini navigation, upper navigation, lot of unwanted stuff appearing") is scoped as its own separate pass, since it's a structurally different page (its own `.drawer`/`.backdrop` bottom-sheet system, its own `ashtadhyayi.js`, genuinely duplicate navigation controls to untangle first) rather than a mechanical repeat of this fix.

- **Selection tooltip (#actionTooltip) revamped to stop colliding with the native browser selection toolbar, and the global-search scope-picker's overflow bug fixed, 24 Aug (project lead's follow-up live-testing report after the exact-match merge: "it needs revamping. contextual menus" plus 8 fresh screenshots).** Two real, screenshot-confirmed issues investigated and fixed:
  - **The scope-picker popup ("Everything ▾" etc., built as a custom button+popup-list in the search-scope-dropdown entry further down this file) was clipped off the right edge of the screen on a narrow phone** — the button's own label truncated to "Eve…", and the opened popup's option list all cut off mid-word ("Āgam", "Darś", "Dasa", …). Root cause, found by reading the CSS: `.dge-gs-input{flex:1}` had no `min-width:0`, so on a narrow viewport the search input refused to shrink below its intrinsic content width (the classic flexbox-input gotcha), pushing the two `flex:none` schemewrap buttons (script picker + scope picker) and their popups past the panel's right edge, where `.dge-gs-panel{overflow:hidden}` clipped them. One-line fix: `min-width:0` on `.dge-gs-input`. Verified in a real headless Chromium session at 390px width with 15 section names (including the longest ones) — button and every popup option now fully within the viewport, none clipped.
  - **`#actionTooltip` (the "Ask Acharya" + word-tools selection popup) visibly collided with Android/iOS Chrome's own native Translate/Copy/Select-all toolbar**, confirmed exactly by the screenshots (two overlapping boxes — the greyish native pill and the app's dark tooltip — fighting for the same screen real estate over a selected word, and again over a Dhātu conjugation table selection). Root cause: both position themselves relative to the *exact same* selection bounding rect, with the *exact same* above-preferred/below-fallback logic — `ai.js`'s old code put the tooltip at `rect.bottom + 8` (or `rect.top - 95` when short on room below), which is essentially the same zone the native toolbar defaults to. They were never going to avoid each other.
    - Fixed by no longer letting the tooltip sit *immediately above* the selection on mobile (<760px, this app's own desktop breakpoint) at all: it now stays *below* the selection with real clearance (48px, not 8), and only when even that doesn't fit does it dock at the top chrome edge instead — clear across the screen from wherever the native toolbar renders, rather than touching it. Desktop keeps the original tight-clearance placement unchanged (no auto-popup native toolbar to collide with there).
    - **A real second-order bug caught while building this, not shipped**: the fallback-to-top-dock decision needs to know whether `.bottom-player` is currently visible, to know how much room is actually available below the selection. The obvious check, `player.offsetParent`, is *always* `null` for a `position:fixed` element regardless of visibility (a real, easy-to-hit spec gotcha, not a typo) — silently making the code think there was no player and over-estimating available room, which in turn meant the tooltip could still overflow past the player's own top edge. Fixed by checking `getComputedStyle(player).display !== 'none'` instead, actually caught by the verification test below, not by inspection.
    - `#actionTooltip` also gained `max-height: min(60vh, 420px); overflow-y: auto` — the full stack (Ask Acharya's 4 query buttons + up to 5 word-tools buttons) can run past 300px tall on a single-word selection, tall enough on a short phone screen that even the improved positioning could still run out of room in either direction; scrolling within the tooltip itself is the honest fallback rather than letting it overflow its dock point.
    - The always-visible कोश/global-search FABs, confirmed in the same screenshots sitting visibly behind/around the open tooltip, are now hidden for as long as it's open — `ai.js` gained a `MutationObserver` on the tooltip's own `style` attribute toggling `body.dge-selecting`, and `main.css` reuses the exact same `#kosha-fab`/`.dge-gs-fab { display: none }` rule the existing immersive-mode clutter fix (see that entry further down this file) already established, just gated on the new class instead. An observer rather than threading a `classList.add/remove` pair through the ~7 places in `ai.js` that already set `tooltip.style.display` — this needed touching none of them.
    - **Honestly caveated, not glossed over**: the native OS/browser selection toolbar is not a page element — it cannot be inspected, controlled, or even reliably reproduced from Playwright (it only appears on a real user touch-drag selection, not a programmatic `Selection` API call, which is all an automated test can drive), so this could not be end-to-end verified against the actual native toolbar the way this project's other fixes have been. What *was* verified live, in a real headless Chromium session: the tooltip now sits with genuine clearance from the selection on either side (never touching it, unlike before), the fallback top-dock path was actually exercised (not just theorized) and confirmed to land clear of both the selection and the player, and the FABs correctly hide while the tooltip is open and reappear the instant the selection is cleared.
  - Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change, no Python surface touched).

- **Global search's "Exact spelling only" filter, 24 Aug (the exact-match mode flagged as genuinely-new-feature-needing-sign-off in the resilience entry below, approved by the project lead — "Sure. Go ahead. No problem." — after "search is the soul of DGE" reopened the whole backlog).** The gap this closes: `dge-search.js`'s single scoring path deliberately folds sandhi-related spelling variation into one phonetic key (nasal-class `n`/`m`/`ñ`/`ṅ`→one symbol, sibilant `ś`/`ṣ`/`s`→one symbol, etc.) so "Nakha" correctly also surfaces "Makha" — the right behaviour by default, but with no way for a reader who specifically wants only the literal spelling they typed to ask for that.
  - **Architecture-respecting by construction, not by restraint**: `SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 says leave the repository layout as-is, so this is a pure client-side post-filter over results the existing pipeline already returned — no index rebuild, no new postings/manifest shape, no extra network round trip. `global-search.js` gained `queryToDevanagari(input)` (mirrors `queryOpts()`'s existing script-autodetection, but resolves to Devanagari instead of SLP1, computed once per query and cached in `lastQueryDeva`) and a new `filterState.exact` flag, applied in `applyFilters()` by requiring each hit's own Devanagari snippet to literally contain `lastQueryDeva` as a substring — the same snippet already fetched and already rendered, nothing new fetched to check it.
  - Surfaced as a new filter-bar chip, "Exact spelling only," shown only once a query has actually run (`lastQueryDeva` truthy — no point offering it against an empty search box) and, unlike every other filter, **persisted across a new search** rather than reset each time (`filterState = {..., exact: filterState.exact}` in `render()`) — a reader who turned strict matching on almost certainly wants it to stay on for their next query too, not silently fall back to fuzzy.
  - **Verification pair chosen deliberately, not arbitrarily**: सर्व and षर्व fold to the identical `pkey`/trigram set (sibilant folding) but have different literal `slp1` — confirmed via direct `node -e` calls against `dge-normalize.js` before writing any UI code, giving an exact case where the toggle's effect is unambiguous (2 results with it off, exactly 1 — the literal सर्व — with it on).
  - **A real Playwright-environment gotcha hit and fixed while verifying, not shipped as a workaround**: the first test attempt against a routed fake index consistently got real 404s instead of the fixture data, with `page.route()`'s own handler never firing at all despite the request reaching the exact right URL. Root cause, found by reading `dge/sw.js`: the app's own service worker (`self.skipWaiting()` + `clients.claim()` on activate, registered by `offline.js`) takes control of the test page within the same load and intercepts every same-origin fetch — including the same-origin fake-index URL used for the test fixture — inside its own `fetch(req)` call, which runs in the Service Worker thread and is outside what `page.route()` can intercept. Not a bug in the app (this is exactly the network-first offline behaviour `sw.js` is supposed to have, correctly scoped to same-origin only), purely a test-harness gap. Fixed the *test*, not the app: launching the browser context with `service_workers='block'` so no SW competes with the routed fixtures.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session against fixture data (2 granthas, one literally सर्व, one षर्व, both matching every fetched trigram so the fold, not the search ranking, is what's under test): 2 rows before the toggle; the chip present and inactive by default; exactly 1 row (the literal सर्व one) after enabling it, with the filter-count text correctly reading "1 of 2"; back to 2 rows after toggling off. Zero JS console errors. Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).
  - **Deliberately not done in this pass**: an exact-match option for the coarse-key-only "did you mean" style fuzzy suggestions (none currently exist in this codebase to begin with — out of scope); persisting the exact-match preference in `localStorage` across page loads (kept session-only/per-search-session for now, matching how every other filter already behaves, since none of them are currently write-through to storage either).

- **The missing JS/Python search-normalizer parity test, built for real, 24 Aug (same "search is the soul of DGE" directive — the "get the right text" half, not the speed half).** `dge-normalize.js`'s own docstring has claimed since before this session that "a Node parity test (`test-parity.js`) asserts exactly that against real data" — that the JS query-time normalizer and `search_toolkit_pkg/normalize.py`'s index-time normalizer produce identical `pkey`/`ckey` for the same input. The architecture investigation for this same directive found the file does not exist anywhere in the repo; either written once and never committed, or aspirational from the start. Until now there was **no automated guard at all** against the two drifting apart — and a drift there is silent by nature: a query simply stops matching text that is actually in the corpus, with no error to point at why, which is the direct opposite of "get the right text in the right context."
  - Built `dge/js/test-parity.js` (plain Node, `node dge/js/test-parity.js`, no framework — matching this session's other new test) plus a small companion `dge/parity_compute.py` (imports `search_toolkit_pkg` exactly as `build_search_index.py` itself does, so it's testing the real index-time code path, not a re-implementation of it). The JS test spawns `parity_compute.py` **once**, feeding every test word through stdin as one JSON array and reading the Python-side `{slp1, pkey, ckey, trigrams}` back as one JSON array — a single round trip, not one process per word — then compares against `dge-normalize.js`'s own output for the identical words computed in-process.
  - The word list is real Sanskrit, not synthetic strings, chosen to exercise every fold class both files' own docstrings claim to implement: vowel length (राम), anusvara/nasal-class folding (रामं), sibilant folding (शिव, षष्ठ, सर्व), vocalic ऋ→r (कृष्ण), retroflex-to-dental (गणेश, पण्डित), aspiration (भगवान्, धर्म), gemination (सत्त्व), visarga (नमः), avagraha (सोऽहम्), a no-folding-needed baseline (कमल), and a multi-word phrase (राम नाम) to confirm whitespace handling agrees too.
  - **Verified the test is actually meaningful, not just written**: deliberately broke one real fold rule in `normalize.py` (sibilant folding mapped to the wrong character) and confirmed the test fails with 21 precise, actionable mismatches naming the exact word, fold class, and JS-vs-Python values that disagree — then reverted and confirmed a clean pass again. All 15 words/phrases pass against the real, unmodified pair of normalizers.
  - **Deliberately not done in this pass**: wiring this into CI (no GitHub Actions workflow currently runs any JS test in this repo at all — this is the first). Left as a clean, obvious next step rather than expanding scope on its own initiative.
  - Full Python suite: 187 passing (two new standalone files, neither touches anything `pytest` already covers).

- **Global search's first-query latency shortened with connection warming, 24 Aug (same "lightning fast search" directive, second piece).** The architecture investigation (see the resilience entry directly below this one) found the documented cold-query cost is dominated by request *count* through a third-party CDN (jsDelivr), not payload size (already optimized ~150× in an earlier pass) — and that nothing currently warms the connection or the manifest ahead of the reader's first query.
  - `dge/index.html` gained a `<link rel="preconnect">`/`dns-prefetch` pair for `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, matching the existing pattern already used for Google Fonts. Honestly caveated in its own comment: the page's Sanscript `<script>` tag already loads from this exact origin, likely warming the connection anyway — this preconnect costs nothing (no data, just an early handshake) and removes any doubt.
  - `global-search.js` gained `prefetchManifest()`: fetches `manifest.json` on `requestIdleCallback` (a plain `setTimeout` fallback for browsers without it, e.g. Safari) shortly after page load, well before the reader opens search — so the `Index` object may already exist by the time they type. Deliberately **not** an eager/blocking fetch: manifest.json can be several MB and most readers on any given page never open search at all, so it's skipped outright when `navigator.connection.saveData` is set or `effectiveType` reports a slow connection — the same bandwidth-conscious instinct already behind this app's offline mode and lazy per-query shard/posting fetches.
  - **A real regression caught and fixed during this same change, not shipped separately**: `ensureIndex()`'s section-popup population (`populateSections()`) was originally wired to run only once, tied to the very first promise that created the cached `idxPromise` — fine when `ensureIndex()` was always called from inside `open()` (after `build()` had already created the popup DOM), but the whole point of a prefetch is calling it *before* that DOM exists. Left as-is, a successful idle prefetch would have permanently starved the section-scope popup of its options the first time the reader actually opened search. Fixed by re-attaching `populateSections()` to every call to `ensureIndex()` rather than only the first — it already no-ops safely via its own `data-populated`/element-exists guards, so this is free on every call after the first real one. Also guarded `ensureIndex()`'s own error-path DOM write (`#dge-gs-results`), which previously assumed `build()` had already run — no longer a safe assumption once a failure can originate from a pre-open prefetch.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session (with a routed fake index, the real CDN being unreachable from this sandbox): `manifest.json` is fetched via the idle prefetch with the search overlay never opened; opening search afterward correctly populates the section-scope popup from the already-cached, already-resolved prefetch (the exact regression above, confirmed NOT to occur); the manifest is fetched exactly once, not re-fetched on open; and the fetch is confirmed skipped entirely when `navigator.connection.saveData` is simulated true. Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Global search made resilient to a single flaky request, 24 Aug ("search is the soul of DGE... lightning fast... apply all your brain" — the project lead's explicit directive to work the search backlog, architecture unchanged as instructed).** Before touching anything, ran a full investigation of the current search architecture (`global-search.js`/`dge-search.js`/`dge-normalize.js`/`build_search_index.py`/`SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md`) rather than guessing — confirmed the 330 MB CDN-hosted, per-trigram-per-section-sharded index design is deliberate, already measured/optimized (a documented ~150× payload reduction from an earlier pass), and explicitly directed to stay as-is ("leave the repository layout as it is" — `SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md` §4). Every fetch stage (postings across trigrams, postings across sections for an unscoped query, shard opens) was already correctly parallelized via `Promise.all` — no accidental sequential-await bug to fix.
  - **What WAS a real bug, found by reading the fetch code closely**: `dge-search.js`'s browser `fetchJSON` only resolved to `null` on a 404 (by design — a grantha with no postings for a trigram is normal). A genuine network-level failure — a real risk against a third-party CDN (jsDelivr) under real mobile conditions — instead **rejected** the promise. Since a single unscoped query fans out to up to ~33 parallel posting requests and up to 120 parallel shard requests, each batched through its own `Promise.all`, **one flaky request anywhere in that batch was silently taking the entire search down**, not just the piece that failed — directly working against "lightning fast and reliable," and a plausible explanation for search "just not working" reports that would otherwise look like nothing at all.
  - Fixed with one change at the lowest level (`fetchJSON`'s browser branch): a network failure now resolves to `null`, identically to a 404, so the rest of an otherwise-successful query degrades gracefully — a dropped section's postings are simply absent from that trigram's union, a dropped grantha's shard just contributes no candidates — instead of the whole query erroring out. Also added `fetch(url, {priority:'high'})` (a progressive-enhancement hint, silently ignored on browsers that don't support it) since every fetch through this path is on the critical path of a query the reader is actively waiting on.
  - **New test, since none existed for this file at all**: `dge/js/test-search-resilience.js` (plain Node, `node dge/js/test-search-resilience.js`, no framework) forces `dge-search.js`'s browser fetch-based code path in Node via a stubbed `window`/`fetch`, simulates exactly one rejected request among several successful ones, and asserts the search still completes with the results the successful requests could produce. Verified meaningful, not just written: confirmed this exact test **fails** (with the raw unhandled rejection) against the pre-fix code checked out from `HEAD`, and **passes** against the fix.
  - Full Python suite: 187 passing (no Python surface touched). This is the first of several search-focused pieces from the same directive — see the connection-warming and normalizer-parity-test entries either following this one or still to come in the same session.

- **The corpus-wide taxonomy-label gap, closed: all 234 remaining segments labeled, 24 Aug (Claude's own follow-up to the Library List view fix above, which found this via a full sweep but deliberately deferred it as too large to rush).** The earlier fix added 9 labels for exactly what was visible in the project lead's screenshot (`pancharatra_samhitas`, `nitishastra`, `upaveda`, etc.); a full sweep of every taxonomy segment actually used in `library.json` against `DGE_PATH_LABELS` at the time found 234 more, unlabeled for the same underlying reason, just not yet caught in a screenshot.
  - Labeled all 234 in organized batches by domain (Mahābhārata parvas, Rāmāyaṇa kāṇḍas, Purāṇas, the Dvaita Tātparya-Nirṇaya corpus's prasthānas/bhāṣyas, Madhva's daśa-prakaraṇa and ancillary works, post-Madhva ācārya and dāsakūṭa composer names, Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika-Mīmāṃsā technical vocabulary, the Vedic kalpa-sūtra schools, Vedic śikṣā/prātiśākhya names) rather than guessing in isolation — grouping by domain made cross-checking each batch against its own internal consistency (e.g. every Mahābhārata parva, every mahāpurāṇa) far more reliable than one undifferentiated list. Verified a handful of genuinely ambiguous bare segment names (`varaha`, `manava`, `kathaka`, `bhatta`) against their actual file paths before labeling, rather than assuming the more common reading — e.g. `varaha` here is the Kṛṣṇa-Yajurveda's Vārāha kalpa-sūtra school (nested under `krishna_yajurveda/varaha/`), not the Varāha Purāṇa, which is a separate, already-distinct `varaha_purana` segment.
  - **What "labeling" means here, and its limit, stated plainly**: every entry is a mechanical Devanagari transliteration of a real, already-cataloged corpus segment name (verified against real file paths, not invented) — not a claim about an author's dates, a text's authenticity, or any other disputed fact. A transliteration can still be wrong on a genuinely obscure or ambiguous term despite best effort; nothing here was fabricated, but nothing this large should be read as scholarly-verified either.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session, not just code-read: `dgeSegLabel()` spot-checked directly against 11 of the new keys (parvas, kāṇḍas, purāṇas, ācārya names) — all correct; the Library's List view was fully expanded (every node, at every depth) and scanned for any remaining English-looking row label — **zero found**, corpus-wide. A fresh Python sweep of `library.json` against the updated `DGE_PATH_LABELS` (the same method that originally found the 234) now reports 0 missing. Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change — no `data/` files touched).

- **Floating "EDIT" tab and Kosha/global-search FABs, investigated per the project lead's direct report ("the edit template button... is still the same. There's not... and the kosha icons and the other one, the global corpus search magnifying glass icon, they are still standing there"), 24 Aug.** Investigated each rather than assuming either was a leftover bug:
  - **The floating "EDIT" tab (`content-inline.js`) is legitimate, correctly-gated admin tooling, not a stray leftover** — confirmed by reading its own gate: `allowed()` checks `localStorage.getItem('is_superadmin') === 'true'`, and `dge/index.html`'s `<body data-content-file="admin/content/reader.json">` opts this specific page in for exactly one purpose: editing that page's own admin-managed text (e.g. the "DESIGNED BY" byline) in place. It is deliberately always-present and draggable for a logged-in super-admin specifically because it IS the only way back into editing mode — hiding it inside a drawer would remove that entry point entirely, and it is already fully repositionable (drag it to whichever screen edge is out of the way, remembered per device) via real, carefully-tuned drag-physics work already in the file. The project lead sees it because they are the site's own super-admin on this device, not because it leaked to ordinary readers — confirmed it is not admin-gate-bypassed. **Left unchanged**: relocating a working, purpose-built, already-repositionable admin tool on a guess would be a regression dressed as a fix, not a real one.
  - **The Kosha (`कोश`) and global-search (`🔎`) FABs are both real, frequently-used, deliberately always-one-tap-away actions available to every reader** (not admin-gated), which is why they were built as floating buttons in the first place rather than tucked a tap deeper into the Menu drawer — folding either into the drawer now would add real friction to something used often, likely a regression rather than an improvement. What WAS a real, fixable inconsistency: the two sat right next to each other with visibly different shapes — `#kosha-fab` a pill (`border-radius:28px`, auto-width from `padding:12px 18px`, text "कोश"), `.dge-gs-fab` a 48px circle — reading as two unrelated, uncoordinated buttons rather than one small family of controls, which is a fair part of "still standing there" looking unpolished. Fixed by giving `#kosha-fab` the identical 48px circular shape and shadow as `.dge-gs-fab` (`kosha.js`), keeping its "कोश" text label (resized to fit) rather than swapping to an icon, since the label is clearer than any single emoji would be for what it does.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session: both FABs now measure identically (48×48, `border-radius:50%`), correctly positioned above each other with no overlap, and the "कोश" text renders centered within the circle — screenshotted, not just measured. Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Selection tooltip made contextual — single-word grammar tools now hide on a multi-word phrase selection, 24 Aug (project lead's direct live-testing report).** The report: "clicking on a word or selecting a word should display the options contextually. That is also not happening." Investigated live before assuming which half was broken: the tooltip itself was NOT failing to appear — a real `Selection` correctly showed it, positioned it, and populated it, verified directly rather than guessed. The actual gap was the "contextually" part: `#wordToolsRow`'s Shabda/Dhātu/Sandhi/Samasa buttons showed up identically whether the reader selected one word or dragged across a whole phrase, even though each of those tools does a lookup that only makes sense for exactly one word (a declension table, a dhātupāṭha root search, a per-word sandhi split) — tapping any of them on a multi-word selection was a dead end, not a contextual option, which is a fair reading of "not happening."
  - `ai.js`'s new `dgeUpdateWordToolsForSelection(txt)` hides the four single-word-only buttons (now marked `data-word-only` in `index.html`) whenever the resolved selection contains whitespace (a phrase), called from the same `selectionchange` handler that already shows/positions the tooltip — no new event wiring needed. "🔍 Where else" (corpus search) stays visible for both, since searching a multi-word phrase is a reasonable thing to do.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session, screenshotted both states: a single-word selection shows all 5 word-tools buttons; a 3-word phrase selection correctly hides the 4 word-only buttons and leaves only "Where else," alongside the unaffected Ask Acharya row. Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).
  - **Genuinely still open, not attempted in this pass**: the Ask Acharya query-type row itself (Shloka/Word/Bhashya/Custom) still shows the same fixed set regardless of selection — e.g. "⚙️ Word" reads oddly against a multi-word selection, though it isn't a dead end the way the word-tools were (the underlying call still runs on whatever was selected). Left as the next scoped step in this same direction, tracked since the earlier live-bug-fixes pass.

- **Display sheet's Scholar/App layout switch fixed to give real, immediate feedback, 24 Aug (project lead's direct live-testing report).** The report: "if I go to the settings and display, the layout... mobile layout and scholarly layout, they're not getting applied. There should be some way to apply it... And once he comes back, it should be applied. Currently, the old layout is still rendered."
  - **The underlying mechanism was actually working** — confirmed by testing directly, not assumed: `dgeSetLayoutMode()`'s `body.dge-app-view` class toggle, its `localStorage` write, and `core.js`'s own restore-on-load all round-tripped correctly, surviving a real page reload. The bug was real but different from what it looked like: with zero commentaries selected (the default since this session's own multi-select-commentary rework replaced the old "all by default" behaviour with an empty `Set`), App view had nothing to collapse, and the only other difference — 4px of card padding, 4px of list spacing — was too small to notice on a phone screen. A tap that silently produced an imperceptible change reads exactly like "nothing happened," which is what was reported.
  - Two real fixes, not a band-aid: **(1)** `dgeSetLayoutMode()` gained an `announce` parameter, shown as an explicit toast ("📱 App layout applied." / "📚 Scholar layout applied.") on a real tap in the Display sheet — not on `initApp()`'s own silent startup restore, which still calls the same function with `announce` left off so a normal page load never toasts on its own. This is the literal "something which says apply" the report asked for, without adding a separate Apply-button step that would be inconsistent with every other Display-sheet option (Script/Size/Theme), which all apply instantly on tap. **(2)** `main.css`'s App-view density delta widened from an unnoticeable 4px/4px to a real, unmistakable one (12px→20px card padding, 8px→12px inner gap, 10px→20px list gap, plus a softer `--radius-lg` corner and a subtle shadow) — a genuine visual difference regardless of whether any commentary is selected.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session: with commentary explicitly selected, switching to App view correctly hides `.commentary-block`/`.dge-analysis-field` (`display:none`) and reveals the `.dge-appview-toggle` button, exactly as designed. With **zero** commentary selected (the actual default a fresh reader sees, which is what the original report was almost certainly testing against), computed card padding now measurably changes (12px → 20px) and the confirmation toast renders with the correct text, live, on a real click — not just code-read. Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Library List view's top-level category rows fixed to always show one clean Devanagari label, 24 Aug (project lead's direct live-testing report, matched a live screenshot exactly).** The report: "the library is displaying the text sometimes in English and sometimes a long appended something something something. It should be just the parent note that should be seen, not the entire parent child connecting notes" — a screenshot showed rows like "आगमः › पाञ्चरात्रम् › Pancharatra Samhitas" (a 3-level breadcrumb glued into one row) sitting inline with clean single-word rows like "दर्शनानि", plus plain-English rows ("Nitishastra", "Upaveda") with no Devanagari at all.
  - **Two distinct causes, both confirmed by reading the code, not guessed**: (1) `dgeRenderNode()`'s single-child-chain collapsing (a deliberate feature — "Ṛgveda › Śākala Śākhā › Saṃhitā" in one row instead of three taps, for texts nested many folders deep) was ALSO firing on the List view's own top-level category rows, since a category like आगम has exactly one populated branch (पाञ्चरात्र) which itself has exactly one branch (पाञ्चरात्रसंहिताः) — collapsing all three into one row instead of stopping at the category header. (2) `pancharatra_samhitas`/`nitishastra`/`upaveda` (and their immediate siblings `shaiva_agama`/`shakta_agama`/`vaikhanasa_agama`/`ayurveda`/`kamashastra`/`nighantu`) were simply missing from `DGE_PATH_LABELS`, so `dgeAutoLabel()`'s ASCII-fallback kicked in — real folder segments, not typos, just never added when those branches were populated.
  - Fixed (1) with a new `noCollapseAtRoot` parameter on `dgeRenderNode()`, set `true` only by `dgeRenderLibraryListView()`'s own top-level call — every other call site (the recursive collapse-continuation, normal child iteration, and the Grid view's own per-category drill-down `dgeRenderLibraryCategoryView`) leaves it unset, so the tap-depth-reduction the collapsing exists for is completely unchanged everywhere except the one place it was visibly wrong. Fixed (2) by adding the 9 missing Devanagari labels.
  - **A much larger version of cause (2) found while investigating, deliberately NOT fixed in this same pass**: a full sweep of every taxonomy folder segment actually used in `library.json` against `DGE_PATH_LABELS` found **240 segments missing a label** (Mahābhārata parvas, Rāmāyaṇa kāṇḍas, Purāṇas, Upaniṣad-bhāṣya names, Dvaita ācārya/dāsakūṭa composer names, Nyāya/Mīmāṃsā/Vyākaraṇa technical terms, etc.) — the same class of bug as `nitishastra`/`upaveda` above, just not yet visible in a screenshot. Rushing through 240 Sanskrit proper nouns and technical terms in one pass risks real inaccuracy on the more obscure Navya-Nyāya/Mīmāṃsā vocabulary, which this project's own established practice (see the commentator-registry entry elsewhere in this file) treats as worse than leaving something in English — scoped as its own careful, tiered-confidence follow-up instead of guessed at here.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session: the List view's 12 top-level rows all show exactly one clean label each (आगमाः, नीतिशास्त्रम्, उपवेदाः confirmed by name, screenshotted); the Grid view's tiles were already unaffected (they read `dgeSegLabel()` directly, never went through the collapsing); the Grid's own per-category drill-down still shows the collapsed inner chain exactly as before ("पाञ्चरात्रम् › पाञ्चरात्रसंहिताः," confirming the tap-depth reduction survived below the top level). Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Global search's scope picker converted from a native `<select>` to the app's own custom popup, 24 Aug (Claude's own pick — the next item off the "genuinely still open" backlog from the live-bug-fixes pass below, with a working sibling component already solving the identical problem).** Confirmed in that earlier pass and left unfixed at the time: the search-scope dropdown in `global-search.js`'s search overlay was a plain, OS-styled `<select>` — the one light-themed, unstyleable dropdown left in an otherwise fully dark, custom-styled UI, since a `<select>`'s open list is drawn by the OS on mobile and cannot be restyled. The sibling input-script ("scheme") picker right next to it had already gotten the app's own button+popup-list treatment for exactly this reason.
  - Replaced `<select id="dge-gs-section">` with the identical button+popup-list markup/CSS the scheme picker already uses (`.dge-gs-schemewrap`/`.dge-gs-schemebtn`/`.dge-gs-scheme-pop`/`.dge-gs-scheme-opt` — reused as-is, not duplicated, since nothing about them was scheme-specific). `populateSections()` now appends `.dge-gs-scheme-opt` divs instead of `<option>`s (still guarded against double-population on a second `open()`), and a new `currentSection` variable (mirroring the existing `currentScheme`) replaces the removed `<select>`'s `.value` read in `onType()`. Each wrapper now carries its own id (`#dge-gs-scheme-wrap`/`#dge-gs-section-wrap`) so the click-outside-closes handler can close the right popup without the other, now-identically-classed one interfering.
  - **A real, separate bug found and fixed in the process, not introduced by it**: the scheme popup's own "re-run the query immediately after picking a new script" call was `onType()` with no arguments — but `onType(e)` reads `e.target.value`, so this threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'target')` and silently skipped the re-search, confirmed live by typing a query and then picking a different input script. The section `<select>`'s own `change` listener had already been doing this correctly (dispatching a real `Event('input')` on the search box), so the fix was a one-line correction, pulled out into a shared `rerunIfQueried()` helper now used by both pickers so this class of bug can't recur if a third picker is ever added the same way.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session: the native `<select>` is gone from the DOM; the new popup opens/closes on tap and via outside-click, independently of the scheme popup; picking an option updates the button text and the active state correctly and closes the popup; **the original onType() crash is confirmed gone** for both pickers when changing script/scope with an existing query typed — no JS errors, and the query correctly re-runs instead of silently not doing so. The real 330 MB CDN-hosted search index isn't reachable in this sandbox (a known, previously-documented limitation), so section options were injected synthetically to test the population/selection UI mechanics directly — `populateSections()`'s own logic (append divs instead of options) was code-verified rather than exercised against real index data. Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Live-preview Shloka Image Composer, 24 Aug (the other half of the two follow-ups the project lead offered — see the word-tap-to-select entry just below, which was picked first).** Confirmed missing by an earlier investigation this session: `window.shareShlokaScreenshot`/`downloadShlokaScreenshot` (`screenshot.js`) rendered a shloka straight to a canvas and shared/downloaded it immediately, with no preview step at all — the template (background art) was the only configurable option, chosen ahead of time in the `#keyModal` Settings panel, not adjusted at share time.
  - `screenshot.js`'s canvas-building logic (previously the whole body of `dgeRenderShlokaCard`) is now `dgeBuildShlokaCardCanvas(id, opts)`, returning `{canvas, contrastRatio}` instead of going straight to a PNG blob — `dgeRenderShlokaCard(id, opts)` is now a thin wrapper around it, so `downloadShlokaScreenshot`/`shareShlokaScreenshot` keep their exact original behaviour when called with no `opts` (every existing caller). A new `.popup-sheet`, `#shareImagePreviewSheet`, shows this SAME canvas live, with a "Gold Embossed" (the original, unchanged, default) vs "Plain Color" text-style toggle — the latter with a few preset swatches plus a native colour picker.
  - **Real contrast awareness, not a cosmetic slider**: `dgeSampleZoneAverageRgb()` samples the canvas's own pixels under the text's safe zone right after the background/template is drawn (before any text), and `dgeContrastRatio()`/`dgeRelLuminance()` implement the actual WCAG relative-luminance formula against the chosen Plain Color, showing a live "Contrast N.N:1 ✓ Readable / ⚠ Low" badge (4.5:1 AA threshold) so a reader picking their own colour can see whether it'll actually be legible against that specific template's artwork, not just guess. Gold Embossed skips this check — it already carries its own dark recess + stroke for legibility on any background.
  - `actions.js`'s two separate "⬇️ Image" / "🖼️ Share as Image" buttons (which fired immediately) are now one "🖼️ Preview & Share Image" button opening the sheet; the sheet's own Download/Share buttons call the original `downloadShlokaScreenshot`/`shareShlokaScreenshot` functions with the chosen style at the end, so the underlying share/download mechanics (Web Share API with a File, falling back to a download link) are completely unchanged.
  - **Deliberately not built**: a font-family picker. The canvas's text-block layout (line heights, vertical centering math) is metrics-tuned specifically to `'Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit'`; swapping typefaces arbitrarily risks visibly breaking that spacing for a much smaller payoff than the style/colour/contrast axis, which is why only the latter was built.
  - **A real, if minor, bug found and fixed via testing, not assumed away**: `document.fonts.ready` (awaited before every render, unchanged since before this pass) has no timeout of its own — it doesn't resolve until every requested font's network fetch has settled, success or failure, so a slow/blocked font host can leave it pending far longer than a moment. That was already true before this preview sheet existed, but went unnoticed since the old flow just downloaded/shared slightly later than expected; with a live preview a reader actually watches a "Rendering…" placeholder for it, so an unbounded wait now reads as the feature being stuck. Reproduced live in this session's own sandboxed test environment (its outbound font-CDN requests are blocked/reset), where the very first render sat at "Rendering…" indefinitely while every render after it completed in well under a second. Fixed with a 1.5s `Promise.race` timeout that just proceeds with whatever fonts have loaded so far — same graceful degradation the existing try/catch already gave an outright failure.
  - Verified in a real headless Chromium session: the sheet opens showing the real live canvas (screenshotted, matches the established `.popup-sheet` visual language); switching to Plain Color and picking a near-white colour against this session's dark-themed test environment correctly rates "16.2:1 ✓ Readable," black correctly rates "1.1:1 ⚠ Low" (verified against the actual sampled `--card-bg`/`--bg-main`, not assumed); switching back to Gold clears the badge and hides the colour row; the sheet's Download button calls `downloadShlokaScreenshot` with the exact chosen style and closes the sheet; the actions-sheet button text and click-through to the new opener both confirmed. Zero JS console errors (unrelated blocked-CDN network errors aside). Full suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).

- **Word-level tap-to-select fragility fix, 24 Aug (the project lead's own pick, from the two follow-ups they explicitly offered a choice between: "live preview image share and then word level tap to select fragility. Pick any one of this").** Confirmed real and architectural in an earlier investigation this same session: `.shloka-text` was one unwrapped `<div>` per shloka, so every word-lookup path (the selection tooltip's word tools, Ask Acharya, the Kośa double-click popover in `intellisense.js`) depended entirely on `window.getSelection().toString()` after a native drag/double-tap gesture — a known mobile failure mode where rapid re-selection can jump to a shared ancestor and yield truncated or empty text.
  - **Deliberately not a "make every word a link" redesign** — `intellisense.js`'s own `selectedWord()` comment already documents that this was rejected once before, correctly, as turning a page of Sanskrit into "a page of underlines." The fix instead gives each word an invisible DOM boundary: `render.js`'s new `dgeWrapWordsForTap()` wraps every word of the final rendered `mulaHtml` in an unstyled `<span class="dge-word">` — tag-aware (skips existing `<mark>`/`<sup>`/`<br>` markup rather than corrupting it), applied last in the pipeline so it never has to reason about the footnote-engine's or `highlightText()`'s own character offsets.
  - `ai.js`'s new `window.dgeRobustSelectedText()` is the single shared resolver: given the current selection, if its start/end fall inside a `.dge-word` span it returns that span's own complete `textContent` for a single word, or walks the sibling spans between two different words (in document order) and rejoins them for a multi-word drag — both more reliable than the raw selection string, which the fix specifically targets. Falls back to the raw string when there's no span boundary (e.g. a selection made outside `.shloka-text`), so nothing regresses where the DOM boundary doesn't exist. Wired into the three real consumers: `dgeSelectedWordText()` (the Shabda/Dhātu/Sandhi tools' single chokepoint, confirmed via an earlier investigation this session), the `selectionchange` tooltip handler's own text extraction, and `intellisense.js`'s `selectedWord()` (the Kośa double-click lookup).
  - Verified end-to-end in a real headless Chromium session, not just code-read: `.dge-word` spans confirmed present (23 on a real shloka) and visually invisible (`text-decoration:none`, inherits the parent's color, `display:inline` — no layout or visual change); a programmatic single-word selection resolves to the exact expected word via `dgeRobustSelectedText()`; a multi-word drag across three spans rejoins correctly; `dgeSelectedWordText()` returns the real word for the Shabda/Dhātu/Sandhi tools; a real `dblclick` dispatch on a word span opens the Kośa popover correctly (`selectedWord()`'s existing length/whitespace/Devanagari validation untouched); a real tap on a word span still bubbles to trigger `loadShloka()` exactly as before (whole-card tap-to-play unaffected); `copyShlokaText()` still produces clean plain text with spans stripped. Zero JS console errors throughout. Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change).
  - **A real typo caught before commit, not shipped**: an early edit accidentally turned an existing `//` comment into a bare `/` — syntactically a broken regex literal, a hard `SyntaxError` that would have taken down all of `ai.js` (and with it every word-tool/Ask-Acharya/AI-key feature on the site) on load. Caught by running `node -c` against the file before testing in-browser, not discovered live.

- **Previous/Next Sarga/Adhyaya/Maṇḍala/Kāṇḍa navigator, 24 Aug (direct follow-up to the multi-select-commentaries entry below).** The project lead's own direct, repeated ask: "some things must be right at the top of the list... a navigator. Next Sarga next Sarga... Previous Sarga... next chapter, next Mandala, previous Mandala, within a given grantha... Ideally I wanted at the top." Confirmed genuinely missing before building anything — every multi-sub-unit work (Raghavendra Vijaya's `sarga_01`..`sarga_10`, the Rigveda's `mandala_01`..`10`) stores each sub-unit as its own separate `data.json`/grantha entry, with no way to step between siblings except going back out to the Library drawer's taxonomy tree each time.
  - Pure UI wiring, no new data pipeline: `library.js`'s new `window.dgeInitChapterNav()` reads `window.currentGranthaSlug`, checks whether its last path segment matches a known numbered-unit prefix (`sarga_2`, `mandala_10`, etc. — reusing the existing `DGE_NUMBERED_PREFIXES`/`dgeAutoLabel` table), then filters `library.json`'s already-parsed catalog for populated, non-admin-only siblings under the same parent path with the same prefix, sorted via the existing `dgeCompareSlugs` numeric-aware comparator. Prev/next are recomputed fresh from the catalog on every page load, so a newly-added sarga is picked up automatically with no per-file metadata backfill needed anywhere.
  - New `#chapterNavRow` (index.html) placed as the very first child of `.header`, above the title, per the explicit "ideally at the top" ask — hidden by default and only shown once `dgeInitChapterNav` confirms real siblings exist, so a single-sub-unit stotra like PNS shows nothing at all. `window.dgeRenderChapterNav()` re-labels the Prev/Next button text and the "मण्डलम् २ / १०"-style position indicator; `core.js`'s `renderStotraChrome()` calls it on every script change too, same as the rest of the chrome. `window.dgeGoToChapterSibling('prev'|'next')` hands off to the existing `window.dgeGoToGrantha()`.
  - Verified end-to-end in a real headless Chromium session: a middle sibling (Rigveda maṇḍala 2 of 10) shows both buttons with correct labels ("❮ मण्डलम् १" / "मण्डलम् ३ ❯") and position ("मण्डलम् २ / १०"), and a real click on Next actually navigates to `mandala_03`'s URL. Edge cases confirmed correct: the first sibling (`mandala_01`) hides Prev only (Next still shows), the last sibling (`mandala_10`) hides Next only, and a grantha with no numbered siblings under a shared parent (`stotra/PrahladaKrutaNarasimha`) shows no nav row at all. Full Python suite: 187 passing (pure frontend change, no Python surface touched).

- **Live-site bug fixes + multi-select commentaries, 24 Aug (direct follow-up to the mobile UI overhaul below).** The project lead pasted a large external (ChatGPT-generated) product-redesign proposal — 45 sections, essentially "rebuild a global contextual-action architecture, a sūtra/kośa reference resolver, and the whole search stack." Rather than implement it wholesale (it itself says to audit first, in its own §45), ran 4 parallel investigation agents to verify its concrete claims against the real code before acting on any of them.
  - **Claims that turned out FALSE — already solid, no work needed**: search-result highlighting (`<mark class="dge-gs-hl">` already works), proper result titles+breadcrumbs (not raw IDs as claimed), result capping (30) + 140ms debounce (never renders "thousands of results"), the multi-commentary tab switcher already exists. Also: "Ask Acharya" is *already* a working shared contextual-action launcher reused across word- and shloka-level triggers (`window.askAcharya`), not the from-scratch "Genie" system proposed — it just doesn't vary its button list by what's selected, a real but much narrower gap than claimed.
  - **Claims confirmed TRUE and fixed**:
    - **`#displayPopup`/`#commentaryPopup` rendered BEHIND the Menu drawer's backdrop** — matched a live screenshot exactly ("Display" looked stuck pressed, nothing visibly opened). Root cause: both are `.popup-sheet` (z-index 10500) living as DOM siblings of `#actionsDrawer` (z-index 11000, the Menu drawer from Phase 3 below), and opening a sheet never closes the drawer. Fixed by raising `.popup-sheet`'s z-index to 11500 so it always wins.
    - **Dhātu/Śabda modal could show stale data**: confirmed no request-generation guard existed in either lookup chain (`dgeOpenDhatuForSelection`/`dgeOpenShabdaForSelection`, `ai.js`) — tap word A, then quickly word B, and if A's slower response resolved after B's, it silently overwrote B's already-open modal. Both now capture a `myReq` sequence number and skip any DOM write from a superseded request.
    - **Sūtra citations inside the Dhātu/Śabda derivation table were inert** — not "redirects to a landing page" as the review claimed, just plain text with zero handler. The app already has a working in-place sūtra popover (`.dge-sutra-ref` + `intellisense.js`'s document-level click delegate, used by Prakriyā/Rūpasiddhi/the Sandhi tool) — this one table's own `dgeShabdaStepsHtml()` just never adopted it. Reused `prakriya.js`'s own `isSutra` regex (`/^[1-8]\.[1-4]\.\d{1,3}$/`) to tell a real citation from an ordinary paribhāṣā/vārtika reference shown plainly. Verified end-to-end (not just code-read): a real click on a newly-wired citation opens the actual popover with real content for sūtra 3.4.78.
    - **Search's "Nakha" surfacing "Makha"**: real, but for a different reason than assumed — deliberate nasal-class folding (`n`/`m`/`ñ`/`ṅ` → one phonetic key) in `dge-search.js`'s single scoring path, for sandhi-aware matching, not a naive substring bug. Not yet fixed — an opt-in exact-match mode is real, scoped follow-up work, deliberately not rushed into this pass.
    - **Search-scope dropdown is a native, OS-styled `<select>`**: confirmed — this is the light-themed dropdown visible in a live screenshot, inconsistent with the rest of the dark custom-styled app. The sibling "scheme" picker already got a custom-popup treatment for exactly this reason (see `global-search.js`'s own comment on why a native `<select>`'s open list "cannot be restyled" on mobile); the scope picker never did. Not yet fixed this pass — same follow-up bucket as exact search.
    - **Word-level tap-to-select is genuinely fragile**: confirmed architecturally — the whole verse is one unwrapped `<div class="shloka-text">`, word detection relies entirely on the browser's native `Selection` object after a drag (`ai.js`'s `selectionchange` listener), with no per-word elements and no mitigation for native selection jumping to a shared ancestor on rapid re-selection (a real, known mobile failure mode). Not fixed this pass — a real rework of `render.js`'s shloka-text generation to wrap words individually, bigger and riskier than the others, needs its own scoped pass.
    - **No live-preview image-share editor exists**: confirmed, but simpler than the review assumed — no broken/hidden UI exists at all (`screenshot.js` renders straight to a canvas and shares/downloads immediately); the template is chosen ahead of time in Settings, not at share time. A real, well-specified feature request if wanted (live preview, font/color pickers, contrast awareness) — not started, genuinely new functionality rather than a fix.
  - **New feature, not from the ChatGPT doc — the project lead's own direct ask**: multi-select commentaries. "I can only choose one commentary... I can choose any of any number of commentaries, and they should all appear." `window.selectedCommentaryView` (a single string: `'none'`/`'all'`/one specific key) is now `window.selectedCommentaries`, a `Set` (`state.js`). `setCommentaryView('none'|'all')` are the two quick actions (select nothing / select everything, both close the popup); the new `window.dgeToggleCommentarySelection(key)` toggles any individual commentary on/off *without* closing the popup, so several can be picked in one sitting — same multi-select convention the mark-criteria filter (Phase 7 below) already established. `render.js`'s card-rendering `isSelected` check simplified to `selectedCommentaries.has(cKey)`. Converted `#commentaryPopup` from an anchored dropdown to a bottom sheet in the same pass (checkboxes reusing `.filter-checkbox-item`), since a real multi-select list can now genuinely grow long enough to need the room — the same overflow risk `#displayPopup` had before Phase 1.
  - Verified via headless Chromium: the z-index fix confirmed by computed style + screenshot (commentary sheet now correctly rises above the still-open Menu drawer); checking two commentaries in a row keeps the popup open both times and both actually render as separate `.commentary-block` elements on the shloka card; "All"/"None" correctly select everything/nothing and close the popup as one-shot actions; the sūtra-popover fix confirmed with a real click producing real sūtra content. Full Python suite: 187 passing throughout.
  - **Genuinely still open from this pass** (lower priority, explicitly not rushed into this round): an exact/strict search mode alongside the existing phonetic-fold matching; replacing the native search-scope `<select>` with the app's own custom popup pattern (mirroring the sibling scheme picker); a real per-word clickable-span rework of shloka-text rendering (current native-Selection-based word lookup is fragile, confirmed architecturally, not yet reproduced live); a live-preview Shloka Image Composer (font/color pickers, contrast awareness) — genuinely new functionality, not a fix to anything broken; varying "Ask Acharya"'s shown buttons by what's actually selected.

- **Mobile UI/UX overhaul — all 7 planned phases shipped and tested, 24 Aug.** Picks up directly from the Phase 1 entry below (same authorization, same session, continued after a compaction break). The project lead's final go-ahead: "Go ahead and start with these set of changes one by one. You have all rights to decide... you can go ahead and merge as well after thorough testing by taking screenshots wherever necessary," reiterating the 2-3 layout requirement, mobile-first priority with a different desktop treatment, and asked for ashtadhyayi.com-inspired features DGE was missing ("similar ones, if not copy-paste... maybe even enhanced"). Each phase below was built, tested with a real headless Chromium session (390×844 mobile, 1400×900 desktop), and committed+pushed separately, matching the "one by one" instruction.
  - **Phase 2 — Library → left-edge sliding drawer.** The taxonomy-browser modal now slides in full-height from the left on tapping "❮ Library," matching the off-canvas navigation-drawer pattern (Gmail/Slack/Spotify/Claude's own app). `modals.js`'s `openModal()`/`closeModal()` gained a `dgeIsDrawer()` branch that swaps the plain `display:none/flex` toggle for a show/hide class (so the slide can transition) plus tap-the-backdrop-to-close — every *other* modal on the site takes the untouched branch and keeps its exact prior behaviour (verified `aboutModal` still uses plain `display:flex` with no `.show` class involved).
  - **Phase 3 — toolbar consolidated into a right-edge "Menu" drawer.** The crowded icon row (Commentary/Display/Admin/Explore/About/Account/Access — `.top-actions`, whose own comment admitted "crowding is solved by keeping the button count low... rather than by scrolling this row") moved as a single DOM unit into a new `#actionsDrawer`, completing the left/right drawer pair. Every id/onclick/`data-topbar` attribute stayed byte-for-byte unchanged, so `admin-editor.js`/`core.js`/`user-auth.js`/`menu.js`'s `admin/config/menu.json`-driven reordering all kept working with zero logic changes. Two real bugs caught here: bumping `index.html`'s `dge-html-version` meta without updating `core.js`'s matching `DGE_EXPECTED_HTML_VERSION` constant triggered the page's own stale-page banner and blocked all clicks; and `core.js`'s access-tier indicator did `keyBtn.innerText = '🔑'`, silently wiping the new `.btn-top-label` span every time — fixed to `innerHTML` so both survive.
  - **Phase 4 — distraction-free full screen reading mode.** `window.dgeToggleImmersiveMode()` (utils.js) hides every piece of chrome (top bar, header, search bar, char palette, bottom player, the कोश/global-search FABs) down to just the shloka + commentary, matching the literal ask: "the bottom toolbar, upper toolbar, left stuff, right stuff — everything should go away." One persistent small ✕ button is the only chrome left. Deliberately not a tap-to-reveal-chrome pattern (video-player style) — that risks swallowing taps meant for word lookup/selection inside the verse itself, and a reading app (Kindle, Apple Books) is the closer reference class than a video player for DGE's actual use case.
  - **Phase 5 — a second, lower-density "App" layout alongside the existing dense "Scholar" view.** New "Layout" section at the top of the Display sheet. `window.dgeSetLayoutMode('scholar'|'app')` toggles one `body.dge-app-view` class; each card's commentary/analysis collapses behind a "▾ Show commentary" toggle — pure CSS-driven off classes already present in the DOM either way, so switching needs no re-render. `render.js`'s card template gained one small additive insertion (a `.dge-appview-toggle` button, present but `display:none` in Scholar view) rather than any restructuring of the existing card-generation logic. Deliberately a dedicated button, not a whole-card tap gesture — `.shloka-text` already has its own tap behaviour (`loadShloka()`, selects/plays that verse) that a full-card tap would collide with.
  - **Phase 6 — a real desktop-specific treatment, not just a wider container.** Above the existing 760px breakpoint, `#displayPopup` becomes a compact 360px floating panel anchored bottom-right instead of a full-viewport-width strip — full-width-from-the-bottom is a mobile (thumb-reachable) pattern that looked broken stretched across a 1400px+ screen. The drawers were already correctly capped at `min(340px, 86vw)` from Phase 2/3 and needed no further change.
  - **Phase 7 — ashtadhyayi.com-inspired features**, each confirmed absent first via investigation rather than assumed: **Screen Wake Lock** (`window.dgeSetScreenWakeLock()`, a plain manual Display-sheet toggle, not tied to audio playback state, re-acquiring on `visibilitychange` since browsers release the lock whenever a tab loses visibility); a **Search Index source override** (Site Settings modal, mirroring the pre-existing Audio Source override — with a real wrinkle handled: `global-search.js` reads `window.DGE_SEARCH_INDEX` exactly once at script-load time, so the saved override has to be applied in `config.js`, which loads first, not only in the save/reset handlers, and *without* the trailing slash the audio override uses since `dge-search.js`'s fetch helper inserts its own `/` separator); a **basic offline app-shell mode** (new `dge/sw.js` + `dge/js/offline.js` — deliberately no fixed precache list, since this repo's scripts are cache-busted with a per-file `?v=...` that changes on nearly every edit and a hardcoded list would drift stale; instead runtime network-first caching, so an online reader always gets the freshest content and the cache is purely an offline fallback); and a **"Negate this filter" mode** for the mark-criteria filter (Match/Negate toggle next to the existing Favorites/Pending/Practice/Done/Doubts checkboxes, inverting the OR-match as a whole set rather than true per-criterion negation, which the existing `Set`-based state has no room for without a larger restructuring). *Not built*: "comprehensive Navigate to site index" — confirmed the Library drawer (Phase 2) already covers this; no separate feature was needed.
  - **A real cross-phase bug found only by a COMBINED smoke test, not any single phase's own isolated testing**: entering full screen reading mode from inside the Display sheet (the only way to reach it) left the sheet — and the Menu drawer, if also open — fully visible on top of the "clean" immersive view, since `body.dge-immersive`'s CSS never touched `#displayPopup`/`#actionsDrawer`. Fixed by having `dgeToggleImmersiveMode(true)` actually close every open `.popup`/`.modal-overlay` rather than relying on CSS to hide them (a CSS-only hide would also have left the sheet's `:has(.show)` backdrop dimmer rendering, and silently reopened the sheet on exit). This is the reason a final full end-to-end pass matters even after each phase individually tests clean — worth repeating for future multi-phase work in this codebase.
  - Full Python suite stayed at 187 passing across every commit in this sequence (all pure frontend HTML/CSS/JS changes, no Python surface touched except the offline/negate-filter additions, which also didn't need new Python tests).
  - **Genuinely still open** (lower priority, not part of this pass's explicit scope): the second "App" layout is card-density-only for now — a true icon-driven navigation shell (per the original ChatGPT mockup reference) would be a larger, separate build ~~; per-criterion filter negation (vs. the current whole-set negation)~~ **both since built, 24 Aug — see the two new entries above this one (icon-driven Library home screen; per-criterion Include/Exclude filter state)**; and the offline mode's cache is unbounded — fine for a single grantha, worth revisiting if it should cap/evict for someone who browses the full multi-hundred-MB corpus while online.

- **Per-criterion Include/Exclude filter state, replacing the whole-set Negate toggle above (24 Aug, direct follow-up).** The Match/Negate toggle shipped in Phase 7 above only negated the WHOLE checked set at once (e.g. "show everything except favorites-or-done together"); ashtadhyayi.com's own filter panels let each filter be negated independently. Reworked `filter.js`'s state model: `window.filterCriteriaState` now maps each of the 5 mark criteria (fav/pending/practice/done/doubt) to its own `'include'`/`'exclude'`/unset, replacing both the old `activeFilters` `Set` and the whole-set `negateMarkFilters` boolean. `getFilteredIds()`'s combining rule: a shloka passes if (no criteria are `include`d, OR it matches at least one that is) AND (it matches none that are `exclude`d) — the standard faceted-search rule, and a strict superset of both previous behaviors (all-include reduces to the old OR-only filter; all-exclude reduces to the old whole-set Negate). Each checkbox now cycles ☐ → ☑ include → ☒ exclude → ☐ on tap (`window.cycleFilterCriterion`), with a distinct struck-through visual for excluded so it never reads as a duller "included" at a glance. Verified via headless Chromium: the three-tap cycle produces the right `filterCriteriaState` and `getFilteredIds()` result at each step (confirmed excluded shlokas are genuinely absent, not just visually hidden); a mixed include-fav + exclude-done case filters correctly; a real click cycle through the UI updates the right CSS classes at each tap. Full Python suite: 187 passing.

- **Icon-driven Library home screen (24 Aug, direct follow-up to Phase 5's App layout — the "something resembling the ChatGPT mockup's icon structure" the project lead specifically asked for, since Phase 5 only ever addressed shloka-card density, not navigation chrome).** Architecture decision, made explicitly rather than assumed: NOT a separate index file. This app's ~40 JS modules (audio playback, notes, filters, rendering, etc.) are deeply shared and stateful — a second HTML entry point would either duplicate hundreds of functions or load the exact same ~45 script tags anyway, at which point "separate" buys nothing but drift risk between two parallel apps. Built instead as a new view mode on the EXISTING Library drawer (Phase 2), over the exact same tree data.
  - `library.js`: `dgeRenderLibraryGridView()` renders the 12 real top-level taxonomy categories as tappable icon tiles (icon + label + lifecycle-status count badge — same `dgeCountLeaves`/`dgeLibTotalCounts` the list view already computed, nothing duplicated). Tapping a tile calls `dgeShowLibraryCategory(key)`, which reuses `dgeRenderNode` completely unchanged for that one branch, with a breadcrumb back to the grid. `dgeLibTree`/`dgeLibTopKeys` are cached at module scope so switching Grid↔List or drilling in/out never re-fetches or rebuilds the tree.
  - Defaults to Grid, with a "☰ List" toggle (the original text tree, byte-for-byte the same rendering as before this pass) one tap away and remembered per device via `localStorage`.
  - Verified via headless Chromium at 390×844 and 1400×900: the grid renders all 12 categories with correct counts; a real click drills into a category showing the correct breadcrumb and its existing collapsible list; the breadcrumb returns to the grid; List↔Grid switching is instant. Full Python suite: 187 passing.

- **Mobile UI/UX overhaul — Phase 1: Display popup converted to a real bottom sheet, 24 Aug.** The project lead's concern this pass was explicitly about presentation, not functionality: the app should "feel like a nice app" on Android, with 2-3 selectable layouts (today's dense view, a lower-density icon-driven "App" view inspired by an external ChatGPT mockup, and a distraction-free full-screen reading mode), off-canvas drawer navigation "as seen in certain mobile apps like Claude or ashtadhyayi.com," and a specific bug — "some models, tabs, which exceeds the screen length," naming the language/Display selector. 16 real screenshots of ashtadhyayi.com's own UI (left/right drawers, fullscreen mode, filter panels) were provided as reference, with an explicit requirement that the result be justifiable as universal, decades-old mobile-navigation practice (Xerox Star 1981 hamburger icon → Facebook 2011 → Android Material Design's official Navigation Drawer component ~2013-14 → now ubiquitous: Gmail, YouTube, Slack, Spotify, Claude's own app), not attributable to "copying ashtadhyayi.com." The project lead gave blanket authorization to proceed phase-by-phase, test thoroughly with screenshots, and merge without further check-ins.
  - **This phase**: `#displayPopup` (script/size/view/theme, previously a cramped `max-height:70vh` anchored dropdown that could run off a phone screen) is now a proper `.popup-sheet` bottom sheet — full width, rises from the viewport bottom, drag handle, header with a close button, dimmed CSS-only backdrop (`body:has(.popup-sheet.show)::after`, no JS needed). Reused the existing `togglePopup()`/`.show` mechanism completely unchanged, so every `#displayPopup .pop-item[...]` lookup in `transliteration.js`, `utils.js`, `render.js` and `menu.js` needed no changes at all.
  - **A real positioning bug found and fixed, not just styled around**: the sheet initially rendered off-screen near the top (`top:-626px` instead of anchoring to the viewport bottom), despite `position:fixed; bottom:0` looking correct in computed styles. Root cause: `#displayPopup` was nested inside `.top-bar`, which has `backdrop-filter: blur(18px)` — like `transform`/`filter`/`perspective`, that property creates a new *containing block* for `position:fixed` descendants, so the sheet was anchoring to the 50px toolbar box, not the real 844px viewport. Two CSS-only attempts (removing `top:auto`, adding explicit `height`) didn't touch the actual cause and left the bug identical down to the pixel — the real fix was structural: moved the sheet's markup to be a DOM sibling of `.top-bar` rather than nested inside it (the trigger button stays exactly where it was; `togglePopup()` looks the sheet up by `id`, so its position in the DOM tree doesn't matter). Left a comment on both the CSS rule and the new HTML location warning against re-nesting a future `.popup-sheet` under anything with `backdrop-filter`/`filter`/`transform`.
  - **Verified in a real headless Chromium session** at a 390×844 viewport: `getBoundingClientRect()` confirms correct bottom anchoring (`top:168.8, bottom:844`, matching `viewportHeight - clampedHeight` exactly), the backdrop dims (`rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`, `z-index:10400`), clicking a theme option updates both the `.pop-item.active` class and `document.body`'s theme class, the Close button and tap-outside-the-sheet both dismiss it correctly, and a full-page screenshot looks like a real native bottom sheet. Full Python suite: 187 passing, no regressions (pure frontend CSS/HTML change).
  - **All later phases of this same overhaul (left drawer, right drawer, full screen mode, App layout, desktop treatment, ashtadhyayi-inspired features) shipped in this same session — see the wrap-up entry directly above this one.**

- **A real reader UI for `gemini_deep_analysis` output — the gap flagged in the entry just below finally closed, 23 Aug.** The project lead asked to build the accordion-style scholarly layout from an external ChatGPT mockup ("including the schema changes etc") — scoped down from the mockup's static, hardcoded-single-verse demo to the part actually worth shipping: real toggleable accordions over `gemini_deep_analysis`'s already-generated data, in the site's one existing responsive reader (not a separate mobile build — confirmed the CSS is already mobile-first with 760px/1200px breakpoints).
  - **Found the integration point already half-built**: `dge/js/config.js`'s `SHLOKA_EXTRA_FIELDS` + `dge/js/ai.js`'s "🧩 Shloka Fields" settings panel already had `pratipadartha`/`tatparya`/`vyakarana`/`vrutta`/`alankara` toggles wired up end to end (checkboxes, localStorage override, reset button) — they just pointed at flat `shloka.<name>` fields that never existed, since `gemini_deep_analysis.py` stores its output nested under `shloka.gemini_deep_analysis.*`, not as top-level keys. No new settings UI needed at all — repointed each `dataKey` at the real nested path (`gemini_deep_analysis.pratipadartha`, `.bhavartha`, `.chandas`, `.alankara`, and a new `.vyakarana_vishesha`) and added a `renderType` hint (`table`/`list`/`chandas`/`text`) so `render.js` knows each field's actual shape instead of assuming everything is a joinable string or array.
  - **Schema changes to `gemini_deep_analysis.py`** (no existing data anywhere in the corpus yet, so no backfill/migration needed): added `vigraha` (per-word etymology) to each `pratipadartha` item — the mockup's table had a dedicated विग्रहः column this schema was missing — and a new top-level `vyakarana_vishesha` string (verse-level grammar notes the word table and samāsa breakdown don't already cover, optional like `confidence_note`). Both wired through the prompt instructions, the mock/dry-run defaults, and `RESPONSE_SCHEMA_BATCH` (which derives from `RESPONSE_SCHEMA` automatically). 4 new tests lock the schema in (16 total in that file now).
  - **`render.js`**: new `dgeGetNestedField()` resolves a dotted `dataKey` path safely (returns `undefined` rather than throwing when `gemini_deep_analysis` isn't present yet — the common case). The existing extra-fields loop now branches on `renderType`: `pratipadartha` renders as a real `<table>` (columns for विग्रहः/व्याकरणम् are only shown if at least one row actually has that data, so an all-empty column doesn't sit there permanently), `alankara` as a bulleted list, `chandas` as a compact name+gaṇa-structure+lakṣaṇa block, everything else as before. Each field is now a `<details>`/`<summary>` accordion (reusing the existing `.commentary-block`/`.commentary-title` classes so it costs no new visual language) — word-gloss and purport open by default, figures/metre/extra-grammar collapsed, matching the mockup's own default state. Every field carries the same "AI, unreviewed" badge already used for AI-generated commentaries.
  - **A real pre-existing bug fixed as a side effect**: `.dge-ai-badge` (used by the commentary loop's own AI badge since an earlier session) had no CSS rule at all — it rendered as unstyled inline text, not the small pill it was clearly meant to be. Now styled once, shared by both usages.
  - **Verified in a real headless Chromium session**, not just eyeballed: injected synthetic `gemini_deep_analysis` data into a real shloka, confirmed all 5 fields render with the correct open/collapsed defaults, the pratipadartha table renders with real rows, AI badges appear on all 5, and a full-card screenshot at both a 390px mobile viewport and a 1400px desktop viewport looks correct and matches the site's existing theme — then reverted the test data before committing (`git checkout` on the one file it touched). Full Python suite: 187 passing (was 183).
  - **Deliberately not in this pass**: `samasa_vishesha` (compound breakdown) has no settings toggle yet — the data is generated and stored, just not surfaced, since adding it means a new HTML checkbox + `SHLOKA_FIELD_CHECKBOX_IDS` entry rather than repointing an existing one, and it's partly redundant with what `gemini_padaccheda`'s hyphenated compounds already show. Also not touched: the mockup's tabbed (vs. today's stacked) multi-commentary cards, the library taxonomy browser, the audio dock, and the admin editors — the project lead's question about scope ("including the schema changes etc") was answered for the accordion/analysis piece specifically; those others are still open questions.

- **The folder restructure the commentator registry (below) was gated on — executed, tested in a real headless browser, 23 Aug.** The project lead confirmed the shape after two rounds of clarification (a dictation slip — "Joyta Vedanta" — turned out to mean "DvaitaVedanta"). What moved:
  ```
  Vedanta
  └── Dvaita
      ├── SarvaMula      (renamed in place from sarvamula/ -- already filled, = the AnandaMakaranda edition)
      ├── DvaitaVedanta  (moved from the separate top-level dvaitavedanta/, 895 items -- admin-only now)
      └── SetuTila       (new, empty -- placeholder for a second Sarvamula edition)
  ```
  Plus `stotra/pns` → `stotra/PrahladaKrutaNarasimha`, with `metadata.id`/`metadata.DisplayName` added.
  - **Scope turned out much larger than "a folder rename"**: `dge/data/dvaitavedanta/` is also the output target of a *live* extraction pipeline (`tools/dvaitavedanta/` — 11 scripts scraping dvaitavedanta.in — plus two dedicated workflows, `extract-dvaitavedanta.yml`/`recover-dv-structure.yml`). Repointed every `--out`/`--data` default and the pipeline's own `dv_sources.json:output_root` at the new nested path; **deliberately did not rename the tool directory or the workflow files** — they're named after the source site, not the destination folder, so that name stays correct regardless of where the output lands. Both workflows confirmed `workflow_dispatch`-only (no cron), so nothing could fire mid-move.
  - **A landmine avoided, not touched**: `sarvamula.org`/`www.sarvamula.org` is this project's actual live custom domain (`site.config.json`, Firebase auth config) — same word, unrelated to the `sarvamula` data folder. Excluded by construction (every rewrite matched on longer path-shaped strings like `darshana/vedanta/dvaita/sarvamula/`, never the bare word).
  - **A real bug caught mid-move**: `core.js`'s `DGE_LEGACY_SLUGS` table does a *single-pass* rewrite, not a chain — the pre-existing `sarvamoola_grantha` legacy entry pointed at the old `darshana/vedanta/dvaita/sarvamula` spelling, which would have silently 404'd once that path stopped existing. Fixed to point straight at `SarvaMula`, the entry's actual current location, and re-verified in a real headless browser that an ancient `?path=sarvamoola_grantha/...` link still resolves end to end.
  - **New "admin-only" mechanism, built as a general flag, not special-cased to this one folder** (the project lead's explicit ask: "these features must be globally settable"): a `hidden: true` boolean written onto each of the 895 `DvaitaVedanta` entries in `library.json`. `dgeIsAdminOnlyGrantha()` (`library.js`) hides it from the nav tree and quick-jump fuzzy-match; `core.js`'s grantha-resolution step refuses to fetch/render it for a direct `?path=` link and shows "Restricted" instead; `global-search.js` strips any hit under that prefix from rendered results. All three verified in a real headless Chromium run: non-admin sees 0 of 895 entries and a "Restricted" page on direct URL; setting `localStorage.acharyaAuthorized='true'` shows all 895 and the real content. **Explicitly not real access control** (same documented caveat as the pre-existing `admin-gate.js`) — `dge/data/darshana/vedanta/dvaita/DvaitaVedanta/*/data.json` files are still public static files on GitHub Pages; this only keeps the *app* from surfacing them to a non-admin.
  - **Continuity, not a clean break**: `pns` kept as the *internal* `stotraCode`/localStorage/audio-cache namespace (`core.js`'s new `STOTRA_CODE_CONTINUITY` map) even though the folder/URL/DisplayName all changed — an existing reader's saved progress/notes/bookmarks on this stotra aren't orphaned by the rename. `admin-editor.js`'s folder-vs-code consistency check was updated to prefer the new `metadata.id` field over `metadata.stotraCode` for exactly this reason (they're now allowed to diverge on purpose for this one grantha), and its "folder name has uppercase/space" nag now exempts the four newly-PascalCase folders by name rather than nagging on every future load.
  - **What did NOT get rebuilt**: the real corpus search index is a 330 MB artifact on the separate `search-dist` branch (`global-search.js`'s own comment), not part of this working tree — could not be rebuilt this session. Patched the *local* dev copies in place instead (`dge/search_index/backlinks.json` — 322 replacements, its per-shard files, `prayoga_index/a1..a8.json` — ~2,160 replacements total) via precise path-string substitution rather than a full `python3 dge/build_search_index.py` regeneration, and `admin/config/library-status.json` was properly regenerated via its own `tools/gen_library_status.py` rather than hand-patched. A real index rebuild on `search-dist` is still worth doing when convenient — until then, a *stale* copy of that CDN index may still surface old-path hits, which is exactly why the admin-only filter above is applied to every hit `global-search.js` renders, not baked into the index itself.
  - Verified end-to-end in a real headless Chromium session (not just unit tests): default landing page, explicit `?path=stotra/PrahladaKrutaNarasimha`, legacy `?code=pns`, and the ancient `?path=sarvamoola_grantha/...` link all resolve correctly; `tools/validate_data.py` (1,533 files) and the full Python suite (183 tests) both still clean.
  - **Deliberately not started this pass** (see the project lead's own framing — "in future" — for these): a periodic re-crawl of dvaitavedanta.in and ashtadhyayi.com to pick up new/edited/removed content, retrying only entries not already 100% complete on a configurable cadence (their example: 15 days); and a periodic watcher over the OCR staging folder (`dge/data/ocr_staging/`, see the two-stage OCR pipeline entry further down) that auto-runs Stage 2 merge on anything an admin has flagged ready, rather than waiting for a person to trigger it by hand. Both are real, well-specified asks — recurring `schedule:`-triggered GitHub Actions workflows, essentially — but are substantial standalone builds in their own right and weren't safe to fold into an already-large restructure pass. Next session: scope these as their own PRs.

- **`dge/data/commentators.json` — a canonical commentator/author registry, built from `taxonomy.json`, categorised by tradition (23 Aug).** The project lead asked, after the multi-commentary-OCR discussion below, to "revamp the folder structure entirely... fix the actual names, display names afresh as new defaults," then narrowed the first step to "First Generate Commentator Names and Their Commentary Names. And Categorise them under dvaita, etc." This is that first step — the actual full corpus-wide rename is still pending, deliberately not started until this registry could be reviewed.
  - Walked all 5,356 lines of `taxonomy.json`, collecting every `_default_author` field (424 attributed nodes) plus every `tika_*`/`bhashya_*` key. **Found a real, previously-unknown data-quality bug in the process**, not something to build a naming pass on top of blindly — see the new item in "Known unresolved bugs" below.
  - After excluding the corrupted fields, deduplicated the rest into **115 distinct commentators/authors**, tagged with `traditions` (derived from the taxonomy path — `dvaita`, `advaita`, `itihasa`, `kavya_alankara`, etc.) and a `works` list (each work's taxonomy path + schema). A small, high-confidence alias table merges spelling variants of the same major ācārya across Devanagari/IAST/English forms (Madhva, Jayatīrtha, Raghavendra Swami, Vyāsatīrtha, Vādirāja) — deliberately did **not** merge the several distinct, place-prefixed "Śrīnivāsa Tīrtha/Ācārya" entries (Tāmraparṇī, Śarkarā, Pāṅgharī, Vaṃśapallī, Veṇupallī, Liṅgeri, Bidarahaḷḷi, Pāṇḍuraṅgi) — the taxonomy's own labels already distinguish these as different historical people, and collapsing them would be a fabricated identity claim in the wrong direction.
  - Entries carry a `note` field wherever the identification is inferred rather than confirmed (e.g. read off a longer descriptive phrase, or a title-pattern match) — flagged explicitly per the project's "don't fabricate" rule, not stated as fact.
  - **Direct payoff for the Phase 9 multi-commentary discussion**: cross-referencing this registry against `dge/data/stotra/pns/data.json`'s four named commentaries (पदरत्नावली / सत्यधर्मीया / मन्दनन्दिनी / तात्पर्यम्) found that three of the four titles are *not unique* to this stotra — the same three titles exist as tīkās on **Bhagavata Tātparya Nirṇaya** (`dvaitavedanta.purana_prasthana.bhagavata_tatparya_nirnaya`) in `taxonomy.json`, which makes sense since Prahlāda's Nṛsiṃha Stotra sits inside canto 7 of the Bhāgavata itself. Wired the findings into `pns/data.json`'s new `metadata.commentaryAuthors`:
    - **सत्यधर्मीया → Satyadharma Tīrtha — confirmed** (title is literally "belonging to Satyadharma," and cross-checked against three separate `tika_satyadharma*` entries under the same Bhagavata-Tātparya-Nirṇaya branch).
    - **पदरत्नावली → Vijayadhvaja Tīrtha — inferred, not confirmed** (same title exists there, attributed to him; a title match, not independent proof it's the same author on this stotra specifically).
    - **मन्दनन्दिनी → "Vyāsatattvajña" — inferred, not confirmed**, and the name itself is an epithet ("one who knows Vyāsa's truth"), not a common personal name — possibly Vyāsatīrtha (Vyāsarāja), not established.
    - **तात्पर्यम् → no match found anywhere in the taxonomy — left `null`, not guessed.**
  - Also fixed a real, unrelated mislabel caught while touching this file: `pns/data.json`'s `metadata.author` read `"By Tribhuvan Achar"` — the project lead's own name, evidently the transcription source, not the stotra's actual traditional author. Corrected to `"Bhakta Prahlada"` (matching `taxonomy.json`'s own `stotra.pns._default_author`), moved to a new `contributor` field instead of being lost.
  - Full suite re-run after the `pns/data.json` edit: still 183 passing, no regressions.
  - **Still open**: the corpus-wide folder/id rename itself (e.g. `stotra/pns` → a real slug, `stotraCode` on kavyas being a leftover stotra-shaped field name) — large blast radius (touches `core.js`, `config.js`, `state.js`, `admin-editor.js`, `library.json`, `taxonomy.json`, every affected `data.json`'s own internal path fields, and live published URLs) and was intentionally not started this pass so the registry above could be checked first.

- **Gemini dhātu lexicon pipeline: admin-triggerable, 11-language AI meanings + usage notes, independently composed rather than copied (23 Aug, direct follow-up to the copyright fix above).** The project lead's ask: a generic admin-panel pipeline that fetches Gemini-generated data for every dhātu, 5 at a time, explicitly framed as ensuring the meanings this project shows "won't be in the same form" as anything copied from ashtadhyayi.com — new, independently-composed, enriched content instead. Came with a detailed reference spec (system prompt, JSON schema, an asyncio pipeline, a card-based HTML mockup) to adapt, not follow verbatim:
  - **`tools/gemini_dhatu_lexicon.py`** (new): for each of the 2,229 roots in `dhatupatha/data.json`, one Gemini call (structured JSON output, not free text) produces `meanings` (English/Kannada/Telugu/Tamil/Malayalam/Hindi/Bengali/German/French/Russian/Chinese, Roman transliteration even for the Indic languages, per the spec) and `pedagogy` (a short usage-nuance note + 1-3 self-composed example sentences). Checkpointed and resumable — a re-run only fills in roots without an entry yet, `--force` to regenerate. Mirrors `gemini_summarize.py`'s CLI shape and `gemini_client.py`'s HTTP/retry/usage-accounting, not duplicated.
  - **Two deliberate departures from the reference spec, both to close real hallucination risk the spec itself didn't cover**: (1) Gemini is never asked to also re-emit the root/gaṇa/pada/id/artha fields this project already holds and has verified (asking a model to restate trusted data risks silent drift from the true value) — only the two genuinely NEW things are generated, then merged with the library's own verified fields at render time. (2) the reference spec asked for nuances "noted in Dhāturūpanandinī," a real named traditional commentary — this project holds no actual Dhāturūpanandinī text to ground that claim in (checked: not among the dhātu-specific dictionaries found in `bhumandala-kosha-data` during the dhātu-meanings-pipeline scoping entry below), so asking Gemini to attribute its own generated notes to that specific work would risk exactly the kind of unverifiable scholarly misattribution this project's citation-verification pipeline (`gemini_enrich.py`) exists elsewhere to prevent. The system instruction asks for the same kind of content, generated fresh, but explicitly forbids claiming it reflects any specific named traditional source — and a language equivalent Gemini isn't confident of comes back literally `"(uncertain)"` (filtered out at render time) rather than a plausible-sounding guess.
  - **`.github/workflows/gemini-dhatu-lexicon.yml`** (new) + registered in **`dge/firebase/functions/workflows.json`** (id `dhatu-lexicon`, `writes: "corpus"`, superadmin-only) — this is the actual "generic pipeline exposed in the admin panel" ask: `admin/workflows.html` already renders any entry in that catalogue as a clickable card with its declared inputs (dhātu selector, model, concurrency — default **5**, per the project lead's explicit ask — limit, force, direct-push-vs-review-PR), reusing the exact same dispatch/role-check machinery every other admin-triggered workflow in this project already uses. Note: the admin panel's input renderer only supports plain string/boolean fields (checked `admin/workflows.html` directly, no select/dropdown exists), so `model`'s two real choices are spelled out in the input's own label rather than offered as a dropdown.
  - **Rendered in the Dhātu modal** (`dge/js/ai.js` v3.14): a new "बहुभाषा अर्थाः · Multilingual Meanings" section, clearly tagged "AI-generated (Gemini), unreviewed" (matching this project's `gemini_*` labeling convention elsewhere), appended independently of the primary tinanta-paradigm render — same `dgeWithTimeout`-guarded, never-blocks-the-modal pattern as the कोश panel, since the lexicon file can grow to several MB across the whole Dhātupāṭha and must never stall content that's already ready.
  - Verified headless: seeded a real-shaped test entry (भू, including a deliberately `"(uncertain)"` language to confirm it's filtered from display) and confirmed `dgeFetchDhatuLexicon()`/`dgeDhatuLexiconHtml()` render exactly the expected 10 language rows (Russian correctly dropped) plus both example scenarios; confirmed the Dhātu modal for a root with NO lexicon entry yet degrades silently (no section, no error, no hang) rather than showing an empty/broken box. `--dry-run` end-to-end (checkpoint write, resume-skips-already-done, output schema) verified against the real 2,229-root corpus. Python suite: 183/183, unaffected (no existing Python file logic changed, only a new standalone script).
  - **Not done this pass**: actually running the pipeline against the real corpus (needs a live `GEMINI_API_KEY`, which this sandbox doesn't hold — the project lead runs it from the admin panel, starting with a small `--limit` smoke-test batch per the workflow's own default) and a standalone browsable lexicon page (the pasted reference's card-based HTML/CSS mockup is a genuinely nice design for one — the Dhātu modal integration above reuses its spirit at a smaller scale, a dedicated page is a natural, separate follow-up if wanted once real data exists to browse).

- **Ashtadhyayi copyright audit + a real, admin-controlled commentary visibility gate (23 Aug, the project lead's direct concern about ashtadhyayi.com content).** The ask: audit the Ashtadhyayi section and Sandhi feature for anything copied from ashtadhyayi.com specifically (the site owner, Nilesh, personally authored its English commentary — that would be a real problem; S.C. Vasu, Kaumudi, Kashika etc. are centuries-old and not a concern). A background investigation agent found a concrete, real issue, and cross-checked it against the code directly rather than taking the finding on faith:
  - **The `english` field on every sutra in `sutrapatha/data.json` (3,941 of 3,962 sutras) was byte-identical to ashtadhyayi.com's own `sutraani/sutrartha_english.txt`** (`importers/ashtadhyayi_layers.py`, confirmed by diffing against the live upstream file) — rendered to readers as a bare "English gloss" with **zero attribution**, and held only under an informal curator e-mail permission (the source repo, `github.com/ashtadhyayi-com/data`, has no formal LICENSE). `admin/ashtadhyayi.html` already flagged this internally as "resolve before public launch," but nothing had actually resolved it. Whether this specific file is Nilesh's own individually-authored prose (vs. team-curated) could not be confirmed from public sources — flagged as a real gap, not asserted either way.
  - **Everything else checked out independent or properly attributed**: Kaumudi/Mahābhāṣya digitizations (also from `ashtadhyayi-com/data`, but of centuries-old classical works, attributed to Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita/Patañjali — a materially different, much lower risk than a living author's own commentary); Vasu (explicitly public-domain, 1891); Kāśikā (a separate, unrelated StarDict source); Kaumudi ordering (the classical work's own structure, not an ashtadhyayi.com invention); the Sandhi feature (`tools/build_sandhi_index.py`, confirmed built entirely from the independent `vidyut` package's own `sandhi`/`kosha` modules — no ashtadhyayi.com dependency anywhere).
  - **Fixed, per the project lead's explicit direction** ("remove it for now" + "which commentaries to show to who must be configurable"): the `english` field was **stripped from the published `sutrapatha/data.json`** outright (not just hidden in the UI — this is a public static file on GitHub Pages, so the raw JSON was exposed regardless of what the UI rendered; a UI-only hide would not have actually fixed the exposure). `importers/ashtadhyayi_layers.py` now requires an explicit `--allow-ashtadhyayi-com-english` flag to reintroduce it (off by default, with a comment explaining why), so a routine future re-run of the importer can't silently bring it back.
  - **New general capability, not just a one-off fix**: `admin/content/ashtadhyayi-layers.json` — a site-wide (not per-browser) config of which commentary layers and which per-sutra enrichment fields are even *offered* to readers at all, fetched fresh by `dge/js/ashtadhyayi.js` on every load (no caching, so a change takes effect for every visitor without a code deploy). This is deliberately a different thing from each reader's own existing layer toggle (`state.enabled`, per-browser localStorage, chooses *among* whatever this new gate already approved) — the project previously had no site-wide content-moderation control at all for Ashtadhyayi, only kosha.js's per-*browser* dictionary-visibility toggle, which doesn't actually hide anything from other visitors. `admin/ashtadhyayi.html` gained real 👁/🚫 toggle buttons per layer (and for the `english` field specifically) that write directly to this config via the GitHub Contents API — same direct-commit mechanism `dge/js/content-inline.js` already uses for prose fields, applied here to a boolean, batched behind an explicit "Publish visibility changes" button rather than committing on every click.
  - Ships with `english: {visible: false}` and all seven real commentary layers left `visible: true` (their own audit status unaffected — this pass was about the specific unattributed field, not those layers).
  - Verified headless: `ashtadhyayi.html` for sutra 1.1.1 renders Kāśikā/Siddhānta-Kaumudī/Bālamanoramā/Tattvabodhinī/Nyāsa/Vasu and the padaccheda panel exactly as before, with "English gloss" appearing nowhere in the page; `admin/ashtadhyayi.html` loads the config (falls back to a plain read-only fetch when the GitHub API call itself can't be reached, e.g. no PAT saved yet — confirmed this fallback path is what actually supplied the correct `english: hidden` state in this sandbox, which can't reach api.github.com), shows 7 real per-layer eye toggles + one for the `english` field (already showing 🚫, 0% coverage), and clicking a toggle flips it and reveals the Publish button. The actual GitHub-write half of `publishVis()` could not be exercised here (no real PAT/network) — logic only, not proven against a live commit. Python suite: 183/183, unaffected.
  - **Not done this pass, and explicitly the project lead's future plan, not an immediate ask**: an AI-generated one-line gloss per sutra to eventually replace the removed field, clearly labeled as such (matching this project's `gemini_*` "AI, unreviewed" convention elsewhere) — noted here so the next session has the context, not started.

- **Dhātu meanings, multi-dictionary/multi-language regeneration pipeline (23 Aug, project lead's ask) — investigated and scoped, not yet built; deprioritized behind the copyright fix above once that turned out to be a live, concrete legal-exposure item.** The ask: for every dhātu, pull real meanings from every dictionary that has an entry for it (Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī, Mādhavīya Dhātuvṛtti, Dhātupradīpa, etc.), populate a *separate, correctly-sourced* meaning per language (currently Hindi/English are mixed together in the one `artha_extra` field) for English/Hindi/Telugu/Kannada, admin-triggerable and monthly-schedulable like the project's other Gemini pipelines. Real findings from investigating the actual data before writing any code:
  - **A real, already-existing licensing wrinkle in the master dhātu list itself**: `dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/dhatupatha/data.json` (2,229 roots, MIT-licensed via `vidyut`) already merges `set`/`karma`/`artha_extra.{hi,en}` fields from **`ashtadhyayi-com/data`** (commit `24109f7`, its own separate open-data GitHub repo — "free to use ... provided that appropriate credits are mentioned"). This is a different thing from the sutrapatha `english` field above: a licensed, attribution-required open-data repo, not the personally-authored website commentary — but it does mean the *existing* Hindi/English glosses this session was asked to "fix the mixing" on are themselves already ashtadhyayi-com/data content, worth the project lead knowing explicitly.
  - **Real dictionaries exist and were located** in the separate `bhumandala-kosha-data` repo (cloned locally to verify): dhātu-specific Sanskrit-Sanskrit commentaries — Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī, Mādhavīya Dhātuvṛtti, Dhātupradīpa, plus two root-lists (Dhātupāṭha-Kṛṣṇācārya, sasvara) — all from `indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit-vyāṇaraṇa`, all tagged `licence: "Unclear (no LICENSE file)"` in their own `meta.json` (a second, separate licensing gap worth flagging on its own, not raised by the project lead this session but found while looking). General Sanskrit-English dictionaries (mw-1872, apte, macdonell, capeller, etc.) do carry root/dhātu headword entries and can source English.
  - **A real, concrete gap that changes what's actually deliverable**: there is **no Telugu dictionary anywhere in the kosha corpus at all** (koshas exist for sa/en/hi/kn/ta/fr/de, not te) — a Telugu meaning genuinely cannot be "gotten from its respective dictionary" as asked, only fabricated by an LLM with no real source, which this project's own established convention (see the sandhi/kosha entries above, and the padaccheda/anvaya `gemini_*`-labeling pattern) treats as something to flag honestly, never silently substitute for real dictionary data. Hindi has exactly one general dictionary (`apte-hi`) and Kannada exactly one (`shabdArtha_kaustubha`) — thin but real, versus five real Sanskrit-Sanskrit commentary sources.
  - **A real matching problem, not yet solved**: dictionary headwords cite the traditional upadeśa form with iṭ/anubandha decorations (e.g. Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī's गम् is headworded गमॢ, SLP1 `gamx`) that don't literally match the master list's stripped `dhatu_slp` (`gam`) — a real per-root fuzzy-matching or anubandha-stripping pass is needed before any dictionary lookup is reliable, not attempted yet.
  - **What exists to build from, once resumed**: this project's exact conventions for the pipeline are already scoped and ready to follow directly — `tools/gemini_client.py`'s `call_gemini()`, `gemini-summarize-kavya.yml`'s workflow_dispatch+schedule+direct_push/review-PR shape, `dge/firebase/functions/workflows.json`'s catalogue-registration format (read by both `admin/workflows.html` and the Cloud Function, so an admin "refresh dhātu meanings" button is a real, already-proven pattern, not a new one), and the project's settled default model (`gemini-flash-lite-latest`, per the bench entry above). The plan: match each root against the dhātu-specific dictionaries (grounded, real text) + general per-language dictionaries where they exist, have Gemini *synthesize* (not invent) a clean per-language sentence strictly from whatever real dictionary text was actually retrieved, and leave a language null with an honest "no dictionary source" note rather than let Gemini free-generate one — Telugu would need this fallback explicitly, or a real Telugu source found first.
  - **Not started**: the actual `tools/build_dhatu_meanings.py` script, the workflow YAML, the `workflows.json` registration, and rendering the result in the Dhātu modal. A natural next session's task, now that the licensing/data-availability landscape is actually mapped rather than assumed.

- **Dhātu modal now renders the full tinanta paradigm, plus a look at two other live-feedback reports (23 Aug, the project lead's post-merge phone testing of PR #128).** Three things were reported after that merge went live: (1) "when i search for a dhatu, it's forms aren't returning, only its prakriya", (2) "View in full प्रक्रिया browser" opening what looked like a fresh landing-page reload instead of the modal handing off smoothly, (3) सुरस्तोमैरस्तु's Sandhi button not giving a real answer. Also included: independently re-verifying, against the actual live production URLs (not memory), that the two earlier "not seeing the new features at all" screenshots were just a timing artifact — they were timestamped 3:36pm IST, and PR #128 didn't finish merging until ~4:20pm IST, so the site genuinely hadn't shipped yet at the moment those were taken; confirmed by fetching `tribhuvanachar.github.io/bhumandala/dge/js/ai.js` directly and running its real `dgeFindSandhiSplits`/`dgeKoshaPanelHtml` against the real CDNs in Node (no browser needed, sidesteps this sandbox's Playwright-can't-reach-jsDelivr limitation) — both work correctly on production.
  1. **Root-caused (1) for real**: `dgeOpenDhatuForSelection` was already fetching the full per-root prakriya JSON (`data/vedanga/vyakarana/prakriya/<gaṇa>/<code>.json`) but only ever read `d.steps[hit.k][0]` — the ONE matched cell's derivation — and never touched `d.forms` (the full 8-lakāra × 3-puruṣa × 3-vacana paradigm) or the other 71 entries already sitting in `d.steps`, both already fully precomputed and already in hand from the same fetch. No new data, no new build step — a render-only gap. Fixed: new `dgeDhatuFormsHtml()` renders all 8 lakāras as collapsible `<details>` blocks (matched lakāra opens expanded, matched cell highlighted, mirroring the Śabda declension table's look), `dgeDhatuStepsFor()`/`dgeWireDhatuFormsTable()` show any tapped cell's derivation from the already-fetched `d.steps[key]` instantly (no async call at all, unlike Śabda's subanta-steps.js which needs a live WASM engine since not every noun form is precomputed). Verified headless: यान्ति (या॒ "प्रापणे", गणः 2) → लट् expands with the full 3×3 grid, यान्ति highlighted and its derivation shown by default; tapping याति (Lat.00) re-renders correctly; Shabda modal and Dhātu's not-found path both regression-checked clean (shared `.dge-word-modal` CSS block, touched to add the new styles), zero console errors.
  2. **(2) investigated, not reproduced**: `modals.js` has no click-outside/global handler that would plausibly intercept a `target="_blank"` link inside a modal, and the link's own `href="prakriya.html#<code>:<key>"` + `prakriya.js`'s `hashchange`/initial-`load()` handling both look correct on inspection. Left as-is rather than guessing at a fix for a bug that couldn't be reproduced in this sandbox (no live phone access) — now considerably lower-stakes than before, since the full paradigm+derivation from (1) covers what most visitors would have followed that link for in the first place. Worth another look if it recurs with more detail (which browser, does the new tab actually open, etc).
  3. **(3) is correct behavior, not a bug — explained to the project lead rather than "fixed"**: सुरस्तोमैरस्तु = सुरस्तोमैः + अस्तु is **visarga sandhi**, and `tools/build_sandhi_index.py` deliberately only covers the six vowel-sandhi categories it can cite a real sutra for (see its own docstring and the "Real Vidyut sandhi-vicheda" entry below) — citing the correct rule for a consonant/visarga transition from `rules.csv`'s bare `first,second,result` rows would be multi-sutra guesswork (8.2.66, 8.3.x, 8.4.x interacting), and getting a citation wrong matters more here than not offering one. This case correctly falls to the AI path, whose prompt already asks it to cite a sutra "if you can identify one confidently" — not chased further this session (extending real coverage to visarga sandhi with verified citations is real linguistics work, not a quick fix; noted as a follow-up in the entry below rather than duplicated here).

- **Deep grammatical analysis (chandas/alankara/samasa/pratipadartha) — reviewed an external AI's proposal, adopted the real parts, corrected the stale ones, built the rest (23 Aug).** The project lead pasted an external review proposing an expanded per-shloka schema. Verified against this project's own facts before implementing rather than trusting it outright:
  - **Adopted:** padaccheda was conflating euphonic sandhi-splitting (should be space-separated) with samasa/compound-splitting (should be hyphen-separated) into one space-separated output — a real bug. Fixed in both `gemini_summarize.py` system instructions (single-verse and batch). The richer schema itself (chandas, alankara, samasa breakdown, pratipadartha, bhavartha) was a genuinely good idea, built as a new `tools/gemini_deep_analysis.py`.
  - **Rejected — stale facts:** the proposal's "gemini-2.5-flash" is an outdated model string; this project deliberately uses the `-latest` aliases so it never pins to a generation that goes stale. Its pricing table ($0.30/$2.50 for "Flash") is actually the number *this project measured* for the **lite** tier (see the bench entry above) — real Flash cost, thinking tokens included, was $1.79–3.20/1000 verses. Went with this project's own measured data, not the pasted numbers.
  - **Rejected — a blanket rule presented without evidence:** "always 1 shloka per call, never batch" contradicted this project's own real `gemini-bench.yml` run (above), which proved batching helps with zero quality loss *for the existing, lighter schema*. Their concern is legitimate specifically for a schema this much heavier (5 structured fields vs. 3 short strings, ~600-1000 output tokens/verse by their own estimate) — so `gemini_deep_analysis.py`'s `--batch-size` defaults to 1, documented as "unproven at higher values for this schema," not as a universal law. It still supports `--batch-size`/`--concurrency` (same knobs as `gemini_summarize.py`) so a future run can actually benchmark it (`gemini_bench.py`'s pattern) instead of guessing either way.
  - **Rejected — a real design conflict, not just a preference:** dropped `cross_references` entirely. This project already has a dedicated, *verified* citation pipeline (`gemini_enrich.py` + `tools/reference_resolution/`) that cross-checks a detected citation against the actual corpus before trusting it. Letting Gemini bare-claim "see also Bhagavata Purana 7.8" here, with no such check, is exactly the unverifiable-claim pattern that pipeline exists to prevent.
  - **A design improvement over the original proposal:** doesn't re-derive padaccheda/anvaya (already generated, costs real money) — reads the verse's *existing* `gemini_padaccheda`/`gemini_anvaya` as required context, and skips (reporting, not fabricating) any verse that doesn't have them yet. Run `gemini-summarize-kavya.yml` first.
  - Stored at `shlokas[n].gemini_deep_analysis` (a nested object), deliberately **not** registered in `metadata.availableCommentaries` — that catalog is for keys `render.js` looks up inside `commentaries` as a plain string; this is structured data. ~~Building that reader UI is a real, separate, not-yet-started follow-up.~~ **Built, 23 Aug — see the entry at the top of this section.**
  - New `gemini-deep-analysis-kavya.yml` workflow, same `direct_push`/review-PR pattern as the other Gemini pipelines. 12 new tests (`test_gemini_deep_analysis.py`), all passing; full suite at 183.

- **Gemini batching/concurrency/model benchmark for scaling padaccheda/anvaya/summary to the full ~200k-verse library (21 Aug, project lead's direct ask: cost is the constraint, time is not).** `tools/gemini_bench.py` (new, read-only diagnostic — never writes corpus data) ran a real `gemini-bench.yml` dispatch (run 32474178321) against 12 real verses of Raghavendra Vijaya canto 2, comparing `gemini-flash-latest` vs `gemini-flash-lite-latest` at batch sizes 1/4/12, plus a concurrency sweep (1/5/10/20) at batch_size 10. Findings, all from measured `usageMetadata`, not estimates:
  1. **`gemini-flash-latest` resolves to a thinking-capable model (`gemini-3.7-flash`) that spends a large, non-optional number of tokens on invisible internal reasoning** — `thoughtsTokenCount`, which the original usage tracker (added earlier this session) didn't capture at all, silently undercounting real cost. Measured: at batch_size=1, 12 verses cost 4,856 prompt + 2,105 visible-output + **7,175 thinking** = 14,136 total tokens — the thinking tokens alone were larger than the visible output. `gemini-flash-lite-latest` (resolves to `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) showed **zero** thinking-token overhead across every batch size tested (total = prompt + output exactly, every time). Fixed properly, not patched over: `gemini_client._accumulate_usage` now tracks `thoughts_tokens` as its own field (billed at the output rate, per Gemini's pricing model), and `gemini_bench.py`'s `_cost()` and `gemini_summarize.py`/`gemini_enrich.py`'s printed usage lines were updated to account for it — a cost estimate that ignores this field understates real spend, sometimes by more than half.
  2. **Quality check (not just price):** eyeballed both models' padaccheda/anvaya/summary for the same 2 sample verses — both linguistically sound and substantively equivalent (lite even correctly used Madhvācārya's alternate name "Pūrṇaprajña" unprompted). One lite output (batch_size=1 only) had a single minor vowel-sign slip in a compound, not reproduced in the batch_size=4/12 runs for the same verse — normal LLM sampling variance at temperature 0.2, not a systematic quality gap. No case of fabrication or a wrong verse's content bleeding into another's was found.
  3. **Batching lowers cost; concurrency does not.** Real, corrected cost (thinking tokens included, each model priced at its own real per-token rate): `gemini-flash-latest` ran **$1.79–$3.20 per 1000 verses** depending on batch size (worse at batch_size=1, due to more repeated system-instruction overhead compounding the already-large thinking-token cost); `gemini-flash-lite-latest` ran **$0.48–$0.52 per 1000 verses**, roughly 4–6x cheaper, with batching buying only a modest additional ~8% within the lite tier (its cost is dominated by real verse content, not fixed per-call overhead, unlike flash). Concurrency (1→5→10→20) cut wall-clock from 75.3s to 14.6s for the same 6 batches with **zero errors at every level tested** — real evidence it's safe up to at least 20 parallel requests on this API key's tier — but changes $0 of billed cost, since Gemini charges by token, not by wall-clock. The concurrency sweep was capped by having only 6 batches available (canto 2 has 54 verses), so 20 is confirmed safe but not necessarily the true ceiling.
  4. **Production default changed** in `gemini-summarize-kavya.yml`: `model` now defaults to `gemini-flash-lite-latest` (was `gemini-flash-latest`), `batch_size` now defaults to `10` (was `1`); `concurrency` stays at `1` since the project lead said time isn't the constraint — raising it later is free (tested safe to 20) whenever speed does matter. **At these defaults, the full ~200,000-verse library is estimated at ≈$96 (≈₹9,200)** — vs. the ≈$358 (≈₹34,000) `gemini-flash-latest` would actually cost once its thinking-token overhead is correctly priced in (the session's earlier, pre-benchmark estimate of ≈$173 for `flash-latest` was itself an undercount, made before this thinking-token behaviour was known).
  5. `gemini_summarize.py` gained `--batch-size`/`--concurrency`; batch results are matched back to the correct verse by an explicit `index` Gemini echoes per result, never by response position — a dropped or reordered verse in a batch response is left alone and warned about, never guessed via positional alignment (same "don't fabricate" principle as the rest of this pipeline). `gemini_enrich.py` only got the real-usage-tracking fix (item 1 above) this pass, not batching/concurrency — its per-item local reference-verification step (cross-checking each citation against the corpus) makes batching a separate design question, left open.

- **Śabdapāṭha advanced filters v2 + search-ranking fix (21 Aug afternoon, the project lead's "thinking from a genuine smart AI point of view" feedback).** All four asks shipped, each backed by real data rather than suffix-shape guessing:
  1. **Search ranking**: searching a word now surfaces that word FIRST — the reported bug was राम buried behind every -रा compound, ~100 pages in, because results sorted purely alphabetically. Rank: exact headword < headword prefix < exact inflected form (रामस्य typed → राम first, via a `;`-bounded variant list built at boot) < anywhere-in-text; alphabetical within a rank.
  2. **आदिः / उपधा filters** (stem first sound; penultimate per 1.1.65 अलोऽन्त्यात् पूर्व उपधा): dropdowns computed per word at boot via subanta-steps.js's Devanagari→SLP1 converter, listing only phonemes that actually occur (41 आदि options). Composable: ग्-आदि + ध्-उपधा → the 5 गन्ध-type words.
  3. **प्रत्ययान्तः filter**: new `tools/tag_shabda_pratyaya.py` joins the 9,007 headwords against the repo's own vidyut-generated kṛdanta stems (18,486 stems from prakriya/<NN>/*.json) — **413 words tagged with their real pratyaya** (ल्युट् 138, क्त 89, ण्वुल् 72, तृच् 42, शतृ 40, यत् 24, शानच् 5, अनीयर् 4, क्तवतु 1), written as a `krt` field into data.json + the by_akshara shards (shard builder carries unknown fields through — verified, भक्त→क्त, भर्तृ→तृच्). Chips render only for pratyayas that exist; untagged words simply carry no field (honest: the generator covers ~30 pratyayas over the Dhātupāṭha, not every kṛdanta in the language — क्वसु has no generated stems, so no chip). The reader word modal's subtitle now also shows the tag ("क्तप्रत्ययान्तः").
  4. **वचनम् filters**: नित्यद्विवचनम् / नित्यबहुवचनम्, derived at boot from which columns of the word's own 8×3 grid actually carry forms — 17 dual-only (उभ, दम्पति, जम्पति…), 38 plural-only (अप्, अप्सरस्, अष्टन्, अक्षत…), 0 dual+plural-only.
  - All verified headless at 390px (screenshot: full filter stack + combined-filter result), 90-test suite passes, prior features regression-checked (cell prakriyā, modal auto-steps, where-else, top pager).

- **Śabdapāṭha now returns the prakriyā (21 Aug, post-merge session — the project lead's direct ask: "shabda section… must be returning the prakriya"), plus the same session's live-site feedback fixes.** All on `claude/ashtadhyayi-page-enhancements-syr044` (restarted from main after PR #115 merged).
  1. **New shared `js/subanta-steps.js`**: step-by-step subanta derivations from the same vidyut WASM engine rupasiddhi.html ships, loaded lazily on the first request only (a reader who never asks for steps never pays the 1.2 MB). Self-contained SLP1↔Devanagari converters (no Sanscript dependency — both host pages load it from a CDN that can fail). **Feminine stems**: vidyut derives लता correctly only as a nyāp-anta prātipadika (`{basic:"latA"}` yields the wrong लताः for प्रथमा एकवचनम्; `{nyap:"latA"}` yields लता — verified against the engine, then मति confirmed to need `basic` — so for स्त्रीलिङ्ग both are derived and results matched against the form the table actually shows). Avyaya honestly reports "indeclinable, no विभक्ति derivation". Engine-vs-data mismatches are shown as-is with a note, never reconciled by guesswork.
  2. **Reader word modal (ai.js v3.10)**: the looked-up form's own derivation renders automatically under the declension table (रामस्य → राम षष्ठी एकवचनम्, 11 steps; लतया → 19 steps via the nyāp path; नद्याः → पञ्चमी correctly); every other cell is tappable for its own. Also a **"साहित्ये अन्यत्र — where else in the library"** link (§5.2) that hands the word to the global corpus search — rendered only when global-search.js is actually loaded, so it can never be a dead end.
  3. **shabda.html**: every non-empty declension cell is tappable → inline सूत्र-by-सूत्र derivation panel (sutra codes link to ashtadhyayi.html), tap again to close. Per the project lead's screenshots-from-phone feedback: **Prev/Next pager duplicated at the top** (the bottom one is a full page-scroll away on a phone; both stay in sync), and an **advanced अन्त्यः filter row** (stem-ending: अ/आ/इ/ई/उ/ऊ/ऋ/हलन्तः, derived from the headword itself — ऋ correctly isolates the 88 तृ-stems, हलन्तः the -न्/-त् stems) alongside the existing लिङ्ग chips. `?q=` prefill was already honored (verified, not assumed).
  4. **Search index re-published for the new content** (reindex.yml run 10 → `search-dist@60091fb1`; pins bumped in config.js AND global-search.js, which had drifted apart — 3775f74b vs 0195c115). Verified live over the CDN through the real browser code path: राम returns 0.97 hits, and "वक्ष्ये राजनीतिसमुच्चयम्" / "नानाशास्त्रोद्धृतं वक्ष्ये" put **Chāṇakya Nīti first at 0.97** — the newly-indexed texts are genuinely searchable.
  5. **A real search-recall limitation found while verifying, measured, and made honest rather than papered over**: the single word राजनीतिसमुच्चयम् (Chāṇakya Nīti 1.1) returns nothing — its 15 interior trigrams are each individually common, **469 units are "complete" on scattered matches, and the true containment ranked 374th**, past the 120-grantha exact-candidate budget, so its shard is never opened. A second word from the same line fixes it (each word's trigram set is judged independently — measured above). Client fix shipped: `partial` is now also set at zero hits, and the zero-hit message says a longer phrase usually finds it, instead of a bare "No matches." **The real fix is positional/word-level index data — an index-format change, left as a scoped follow-up** (documented here so the next reindex pass can weigh it).
  6. Parallel-session note: PR #116 (Dhatu instant modal + Sandhi/Samasa word-tools, another session's work) touches ai.js/index.html and was open when this session's second merge landed — whichever merges second must reconcile ai.js around `dgeOpenShabdaForSelection`/the word-tools row. **Reconciled by the next session** (below): the subanta-prakriyā rendering, krtTag sub-line, and "where else" link from this entry's exact-match branch are preserved verbatim in `dgeShabdaExactHtml`/`dgeShabdaKrtHtml`, now wrapped in a Promise-string-returning fallback chain rather than the original direct-`body.innerHTML` style, so the new Vidyut-morphology/sandhi/कोश steps below could be appended after it without duplicating the subanta-steps wiring.

- **Real Vidyut sandhi-vicheda (not AI) for the Sandhi word-tool, a genuine Vidyut-backed fallback chain for Shabda, and कोश (dictionary) results shown inline — closing the loop on the previous session's Vidyut audit.** 21 Aug. That earlier audit checked `pip`-installable `vidyut`'s Python API surface and concluded correctly that Samasa has no Vidyut capability at all (re-confirmed here: `prakriya`/`kosha`/`cheda`/`sandhi`/`chandas`/`lipi` are the whole module list, none of it compound analysis) — but it missed that `vidyut.sandhi.Splitter` and `vidyut.kosha.Kosha` genuinely *can* do real sandhi splitting; it just isn't wired up anywhere in this repo. Verified directly this session: `pip install vidyut` + `vidyut.download_data(...)` (75 MB kosha, 1,468-row `sandhi/rules.csv`) works fine in this sandbox, and running it live on **श्रुतौज** (the project lead's own motivating example, screenshotted mid-shloka with a Śabda "not found") resolves it as शrत् + ओजस् (वृद्धिः, 6.1.88) — a real answer, not a guess.
  - **`tools/build_sandhi_index.py`** (new): for every corpus word, tries every split position via `Splitter.split_at()`, keeps a candidate only when both halves are themselves real Vidyut kosha headwords (the strongest available "this is a genuine word boundary" signal) AND the boundary is one of the six well-known vowel-sandhi categories (सवर्णदीर्घः/गुणः/वृद्धिः/यण्/पूर्वरूपम्/अयादिसन्धिः — Ashtadhyayi 6.1.101/87/88/77/109/78) a small hand-written classifier (`classify_svara`, verified against all 154 of `rules.csv`'s pure-vowel rows) can cite a real sutra for. **Deliberately does NOT attempt consonant/visarga sandhi** — checked `rules.csv` directly: it is a plain `first,second,result` table with no sutra-reference column at all, for any of its 1,468 rows, so a consonant/visarga citation would be multi-sutra guesswork (8.2.66, 8.3.x, 8.4.x interacting); a miss there falls back to the existing AI path rather than risk a wrong citation. Also caught and worked around a real, narrow, pre-existing corpus data glitch found while running this at scale: ~18 words (all "कर्तृ/पितृ/भ्रातृ/श्रोतृ/भोक्तृ + stray combining nukta + ण/न") transliterate to non-ASCII SLP1 and crash Vidyut's Rust `split_at()` with an uncatchable byte-boundary panic (`pyo3_runtime.PanicException`, not a plain Python exception) — skipped defensively rather than fixed at the source (a separate, narrow corpus-encoding bug, not this tool's job). Run at `--min-count 1` (unlike `build_morphology.py`'s 2) since a singleton word is exactly the case this exists for — श्रुतौज itself occurs exactly once in the whole corpus — and this output does not ship in the Pages-served `dge/data` tree (already at ~1.1 GB, near the documented 1 GB budget) so the file-size argument for a higher threshold doesn't apply the same way. **Result: 264,819 words with a real, sutra-cited split, 553 buckets, 77.4 MB, built in 4.5 minutes.**
  - **Served from a new `sandhi-dist` branch via jsDelivr**, exactly the existing `wordnet-dist`/`search-dist`/`kavya-dist` pattern (`dge/js/ai.js`'s new `DGE_SANDHI_CDN`, pinned to branch commit `2a255c3d...`, with a `window.SANDHI_DATA_BASE` override for a local build — same convention as `WORDNET_DATA_BASE`) — never committed to main, for the size reason above.
  - **Sandhi word-tool now checks the real index first** (`window.dgeOpenSandhiForSelection`, its own modal): a hit renders the real split(s) with each sutra as a live `.dge-sutra-ref` span, reusing intellisense.js's existing sutra popover (mula text, पदच्छेदः, अन्वयः, अनुवृत्तिः, English gloss, "Open in Aṣṭādhyāyी →") for free — this is the "sutra + link to Ashtadhyayi" the project lead asked for, verified end-to-end in a real browser including clicking through to the popover. A miss falls back to the unchanged AI path (`askAcharya('sandhi')`). **Found and fixed a real, pre-existing bug while testing this for the first time inside a modal**: `.dge-si-pop`'s `z-index:4000` sat *below* `.modal-overlay`'s `11000`, so a sutra popover triggered from inside any modal opened mostly hidden behind it — nothing before this ever put a `.dge-sutra-ref` inside a modal, so the conflict was latent. Fixed in `dge/css/intellisense.css` (now `12000`, above every modal, with no other element needing to sit above it).
  - **Shabda modal gained a real fallback chain** past the fixed शब्दपाठः/kṛdanta lists — Vidyut's own precomputed morphology (`window.dgeAnalyseWord`, already public from intellisense.js, unused by ai.js until now) first, then the same real sandhi index, only then an honest not-found — directly answering "श्रुतौज has no entry in shabdas — retrieve from Vidyut and display": since Vidyut's morphology genuinely can't parse a sandhi-joined compound (documented limitation, unchanged), श्रुतौज correctly falls through morphology to the sandhi split, which *does* resolve it.
  - **कोश (dictionary) results now show inline** in the Shabda modal — first 3 dictionaries with glosses, "See N more कोश →" opening the existing full overlay for the rest — via a new `window.dgeKoshaQuick(word)` in `kosha.js` that thinly wraps the existing `search()`/`loadEntry()`/`applyUserOrder()` (zero duplication of that logic). **A real bug caught before shipping, not a test artifact**: कोश data lives on its own CDN-hosted repo (`bhumandala-kosha-data`, `config.js`'s `koshaDataBase`) with no fetch timeout anywhere in the existing pipeline, and the first version of this wiring `Promise.all`'d the कोश fetch together with the primary Shabda content — a slow/unreachable कोश CDN silently hung the *entire* modal at "searching…" forever, primary content included, discovered because this sandbox's own jsDelivr access is unreliable and exposed it immediately. Fixed at the architecture level, not papered over: primary content (शब्दपाठः/kṛdanta/morphology/sandhi/not-found) now renders and is wired the moment *its own* chain resolves; कोश loads independently afterward and appends itself if and when ready, capped at 8s (new shared `dgeWithTimeout()` helper, also applied to the sandhi index fetch itself, capped at 5s, for the identical reason — a hung CDN fetch must degrade to "no result" / the AI fallback, never a stuck spinner).
  - **Verified end-to-end in a real headless browser**, working around this sandbox's own well-documented jsDelivr unreachability (confirmed via direct `curl` through the session's own egress proxy that jsDelivr itself is fine — `--proxy-server` on the Playwright-launched Chromium still couldn't reach it, a browser-vs-curl networking gap in this sandbox specifically, not a code issue) by stubbing `window.Sanscript.t` for the exact words under test and routing the specific jsDelivr URLs this session's own `sandhi-dist` push actually serves to the real fetched bucket content (`curl`'d through the proxy, not fabricated) — so the real ai.js code path ran unmodified. Confirmed: श्रुतौज's Shabda modal shows the real sandhi fallback with 2 clickable sutra refs; the dedicated Sandhi button shows the same real split and its sutra popover opens correctly on top of the modal with real Ashtadhyayi content; भगवान् (no real vowel-sandhi split) correctly times out after 5s and falls back cleanly to the AI path with the existing no-key message; the कोश panel (stubbed `dgeKoshaQuick`, since the real कोश CDN is equally unreachable here) renders exactly 3 entries with correct truncation and a working "see 2 more (5 total)" button that opens the real overlay prefilled. Regression-checked Dhātu, Samasa (still correctly AI-only, unchanged), and empty-selection guards on all three word-tools — no throws, no console errors anywhere across the whole session's testing.
  - **Not done, and worth a future pass**: consonant/visarga sandhi citation (needs either a much larger hand-curated rule table or annotating `rules.csv`'s own 1,468 rows against the Ashtadhyāyī properly — a real linguistics task, not a code task); a real Samasa capability would need an entirely different tool, since Vidyut has none.

- **Checked whether Vidyut is enabled for Sandhi and Samasa (project lead's ask) — it is NOT, and this session added Sandhi/Samasa as word-tool buttons on top of the honest answer rather than pretending otherwise.** 21 Aug. Audited the whole pipeline before writing any code: `tools/build_morphology.py` precomputes Vidyut's word morphology (inflected forms only — its own docstring already says "Vidyut resolves inflected forms, not sandhi-joined ones"), `tools/build_prakriya_form_index.py`/`build_prakriya.py` precompute the Dhātupāṭha's vidyut-prakriya derivations, and `dge/js/config.js`'s `ACHARYA_QUERY_TYPES` already lists `sandhi`/`samasa` as two *presets under the AI "Word" (⚙️ grammar) Ask Acharya button* — i.e. the only place Sandhi/Samasa analysis existed anywhere in the app was as an LLM guess, never as Vidyut's own structured data the way Shabda (declension) and Dhātu (conjugation) enjoy. No `data/` directory, build tool, or precomputed index for sandhi-splitting or compound analysis exists anywhere in the repo, and the `vidyut` Python package itself isn't installed in this sandbox to check further. **The project lead also asked, separately, for every word-tool button (not just Shabda) to answer inline in a modal instead of navigating away, and specifically called out that Dhātu still opened its own page** — both addressed together:
  - **`dge/js/ai.js`: Dhātu word-tool now opens an instant in-page modal**, matching Shabda's existing pattern exactly (same visual language, same `dsm-*` class names — refactored the Shabda modal's ID-scoped `<style>` into a shared `.dge-word-modal` class via a new `dgeEnsureWordModalStyle()`/`dgeEnsureWordModalShell()` pair so both modals draw from one stylesheet instead of duplicating it). `dgeOpenDhatuForSelection` used to `window.open('', '_blank')` and point the tab at a resolved URL once `data/vedanga/vyakarana/prakriya/formindex/<codepoint>.json` answered which root/lakāra/puruṣa/vacana cell a tapped surface form belongs to; it now fetches that same shard (`dgeFindDhatuFormHit`), then the per-root prakriya JSON, and renders the real root/artha/gaṇa/pada header plus the actual step-by-step sūtra derivation inline (reusing `dgeShabdaStepsHtml`, the same renderer the kṛdanta path already used) — real Vidyut-sourced data, not a guess. A "View in full प्रक्रिया browser ↗" link stays at the bottom for the full page, and a no-match still gets the same honest not-found + report-missing message as Shabda's, just phrased for a verb form. Verified headless: उवाच → real derivation from ब्रूञ् (गणः 2, परस्मैपदम्) through the actual liṭ-perfect sūtra chain ending at ऊ+च्+ए, rendered inline; screenshot confirms the modal visual matches Shabda's.
  - **New Sandhi (🔗) and Samasa (🧩) buttons on `#wordToolsRow`**, since there's no Vidyut data to back a structured lookup the way Shabda/Dhātu have: these call `window.askAcharya(event, 'sandhi'|'samasa')` directly — two new fixed-instruction branches in `askAcharya()`'s prompt-building (not configurable presets like the existing "Word" button's; a plain word-tool, so no `dgeGetEffectiveQueryTypes()` layering) that ask specifically for Sandhi-vichcheda or Samasa-vigraha of just the tapped word, reusing the existing `acharyaModal`/`dgeRunAcharyaQuery` machinery (multi-provider, parallel-mode, follow-up chat, share button, the same "Acharya is meditating, configure a key" no-key fallback) rather than building a second, thinner AI pipeline. A new `#acharyaAiOnlyNote` banner ("🔎 AI-generated analysis — Vidyut... has no precomputed data for this yet, unlike Shabda and Dhātu. Please verify independently.") is shown only for these two types — set as early as possible in `askAcharya()` (before the no-providers early return) so it's visible even on the "configure a key" message, which is exactly where a Sandhi/Samasa visitor most needs the explanation of why a key is required at all when Shabda/Dhātu never ask for one. Verified headless three ways: (1) no key configured → friendly meditating-Acharya message with the note visible; (2) a mocked Gemini response (`page.route` intercepting the real API call, since no real key exists in this sandbox) → confirmed the exact prompt sent (`"...Provide its Sandhi-vichcheda... citing the Ashtadhyayi sutra number if you can identify one confidently..."`) and the markdown response rendering correctly with follow-up box available; (3) regression check — opening Sandhi then Shloka then Word(grammar) confirms the note shows only for Sandhi/Samasa and never leaks into the other, unrelated Ask Acharya types.
  - **`#wordToolsRow` grew from 3 buttons to 5 and needed a layout fix**: `.tooltip-row` had no `flex-wrap` and `#actionTooltip` had no width cap, so 5 buttons just kept the tooltip growing wider than the viewport instead of wrapping — caught via a real headless screenshot at 480px width showing "Where else" cut off past the right edge. Fixed with `flex-wrap: wrap` on `.tooltip-row` and `max-width: min(94vw, 460px)` on `#actionTooltip`; verified both at a 480px phone width (wraps to 2 rows, fully on-screen) and a 1280px desktop width (same wrap, no regression — the existing 3-button Ask Acharya row above it is unaffected since it already fit).
  - Cache-bust bumped for `js/ai.js` (v3.10) and `css/main.css` in `dge/index.html`; `run_tests.sh`'s 90 Python tests pass unaffected (no Python touched). Not done, and worth a future pass if the project lead wants real (non-AI) Sandhi/Samasa: installing the actual `vidyut` Rust/Python package server-side and precomputing a sandhi-split index / compound-segmentation index the same way `build_morphology.py` does for inflection — a genuinely new data pipeline, not a small follow-up, which is why this pass used the existing Ask Acharya AI path instead of blocking the whole feature on that.

- **Vyākaraṇa/Chandas overhaul (overnight autonomous session, 20–21 Aug), per the project lead's brief ("better than ashtadhyayi.com") + 39 reference screenshots.** All shipped on `claude/ashtadhyayi-page-enhancements-syr044`, each piece browser-verified at 360px/768px/1280px before its commit. Summary of what landed, what was found along the way, and what's deliberately not done:
  1. **रूपसिद्धिः (`dge/rupasiddhi.html`) — the derivation workbench, and the session's centerpiece.** vidyut-prakriya (Apache-2.0, Ambuda — the same engine `tools/build_prakriya.py` already uses natively) compiled to WebAssembly (`dge/wasm/vidyut/`, built from the crate's own wasm bindings with wasm-pack, no source changes; 1.2 MB, ~470 KB gzipped over Pages) and run fully client-side. Any root × any upasarga stack × any sanadi chain (णिच्/सन्/यङ्/यङ्लुक्, singly or सन्+णिच्/णिच्+सन्) × कर्तरि/कर्मणि × all **11** lakāras (लेट्, आशीर्लिङ्, लृङ् included), every form opening its full step-by-step prakriyā with each rule named and tappable. Kṛdanta section: ~30 pratyayas in traditional groups, each with derivation + full 8×3×3 declension tables (सम्बोधन included) derived for the exact combo on screen — प्र+क्त्वा correctly yields ल्यप् (प्रभूय), प्र+क्त declines प्रभूतः/-तौ/-ताः. This is the ashtadhyayi.com upasarga/dhatu workbench equalled on engine (it ships the same vidyut wasm) and exceeded on exposed capability (their builder doesn't offer कर्मणि×सनादि combos, लेट्, or per-form steps for every mode). **Deliberate scope limits, not faked:** the wasm bindings expose mūla dhātus only — **नामधातु** (क्यच् etc.) and **कर्मकर्तरि** are not offered anywhere; adding them needs a small upstream binding change (vidyut itself supports both), a clean future PR to vidyut.
  2. **Full Siddhānta-Kaumudī navigation on the sūtra page.** `kaumudi_order/data.json` v2 (from sutraani's own skn/lskn/sk_chapter fields, joined by per-pada text alignment): **3,961/3,962** sutras mapped (was ~1,100 — **and those old numbers were wrong**: the old build matched against `ska/data.txt` believing it was the SK; that file is some other sutra collection entirely — its row 48 is not अनचि च. Verified the new mapping against the phone screenshots: their 8.4.47 = कौमुदी-४८ = our 8.4.46). Dual-order header (अष्टाध्यायी ‹› | कौमुदी ‹›, either order drivable), 70-prakaraṇa drawer with the traditional names (list cross-checked at chapter boundaries: ch.3 opens इको यणचि, ch.43 वर्तमाने लट्), LSK position badge, jump box takes `sk 350`/`lsk 32`/Devanagari digits.
  3. **The anuvṛtti/adhikāra graph is now navigable both ways.** `tools/add_adhikara_refs.py` restores the adhikāra origin refs (14,246, all resolved — incl. the merge case where source counts विभाषा 2.1.11 separately) as `adhikara_refs` structure; the analysis panel links अनुवृत्तिः sources, अधिकारः origins, the forward "carried into" trace, and for adhikāra heads the full governing span (अनभिहिते 2.3.1 → "governs through 2.3.2…2.3.72, 71 sūtras").
  4. **SK self-citations fixed → feature.** 748 SK-layer sutras rendered raw `<{SK354}>` markup (visible on 1.1.4 — almost certainly the reported "4th item in the SK dataset" text problem; the stored text itself matches the source byte-for-byte, checked). Now rendered as live कौमुदी-३५४ links that jump by SK position. `<{उ…}>` uṇādi refs render as quiet labels.
  5. **छन्दोविश्लेषणम् (`dge/chandas.html`).** Fresh JS analyzer (laghu/guru + gana + yati grid) over the 245-vṛtta DB that was already in the repo unused; sama/ardhasama/viṣama/upajāti/mātrā matching, अनुष्टुप् by rule with the traditional lakṣaṇa, nearest-vṛtta report instead of a guess on no match. Verified: Gītā 1.1 → अनुष्टुप् पथ्या; मेघदूत → मन्दाक्रान्ता; या कुन्देन्दु → शार्दूलविक्रीडित; the Vṛttaratnākara's इन्द्रवज्रा definition identifies itself. Kavya reader's metre tag deep-links in with the verse prefilled. **Gotcha recorded:** Devanagari nukta letters NFC-decompose and silently corrupt literal regex character classes — the syllabifier's classes are \u escapes for that reason. **Not done:** recitation audio (no recordings in the repo; sanskritsahitya.org has Shatavadhani Ganesh's — licence unknown, don't copy).
  6. **Sūtra page affordances:** 🔍 प्रयोगाः (corpus-wide search prefilled with the sūtra's words), ✏️ correction report (same `[DGE-CONTENT-GAP]` template as shabda/modals), and on `krdanta.html` every kṛt pratyaya links its authorizing sūtra — read off the derivation itself, never a hand list (first-changed-step pointed one rule early for participles — शतृ got 3.2.123 instead of 3.2.124 — caught in browser and fixed by matching the step that introduces the pratyaya's own name).
  7. **GRETIL page markers stripped at render.** The smṛti imports carry "(इ,१, प्. ३७)" = "(I,1, p. 37)" transliterated wholesale — 357 occurrences, measured to be confined entirely to `smriti_dharma` before writing the narrow strip (`dgeStripEditionMarkers`, core.js v3.10). This is the "Smriti formatting" complaint and mission 4.4's "hide raw source reference markers" in one.
  8. **Branding:** shabda.html's masthead source link moved to a quiet footer credit (the source's terms need credit, not a header). Credits everywhere live in footers/ⓘ-source toggles.
  9. **Corpus search filter pills (§5.3, done late in the session):** All / मूलग्रन्थाः / व्याख्याः (slug-naming heuristic: tika/bhashya/vyakhya/…), category pills with counts, comma-separated keyword narrowing — client-side over results already in hand, fresh query resets pills. Also fixed: `go()` navigated page-relative, so a search result tapped from ashtadhyayi.html (which now carries the search) would have opened `ashtadhyayi.html?path=…`; routes to the reader now. **Verified against a stubbed index** — the production shards live on jsDelivr, which this sandbox's browser can't reach (known limitation, same as the kosha case); worth one re-check against the live index from a real network.
  12. **Dhatuvritti nodes — "relevant text only" (project lead's morning report: the vrittis read as dumps).** `tools/build_vritti_nodes.py` structures the 499 long vrittis into offset-bounded, classified nodes (रूपाणि / सूत्रनिर्देशः / आचार्यमतम् / सामान्यचर्चा); the relevance signal is the root's **own vidyut-generated paradigm** (a node is dhatu-specific iff it contains one of the root's 1,069 known surface forms or a root-prefixed word) — exact, zero fabrication risk, no AI needed. dhatu.js shows a धातुविशिष्टम्/सर्वम् toggle with an honest folded-count; भू's 94 KB Mādhavīya wall → 135 tagged sections, 44 folded by default. **Gemini deliberately NOT used for v1** (the lead floated it; the deterministic signal is strictly stronger for relevance) — a semantic category layer (अर्थनिर्णय vs व्युत्पत्ति) remains a clean follow-on via the gemini-enrich Action pattern if wanted.
  11. **साहित्ये प्रयोगाः + auto-interlink (added after the project lead's morning direction: our prayoga priority is the Mādhva lineage, not भट्टिकाव्य).** `tools/build_sutra_prayoga_index.py` finds where each sūtra is actually used across the grantha corpus — verbatim quotes (Aho-Corasick over normalized text) + explicit पा.सू. numeric citations — ranked lineage-first: सर्वमूल → द्वैतवेदान्त corpus (Sumadhva Vijaya, Yuktimallikā, Nyāya Sudhā, later ācāryas) → दाससाहित्य → rest. **734 sūtras, 2,197 usages** (कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया alone quoted in 23 Dvaita ṭīkā passages). Every precision guard came from inspecting a build, not trusting it: word boundaries (तस्य तात् 7.1.44 matched inside every तस्य तात्पर्यम्), citation signals for short sūtras (प्रत्ययः 3.1.1 had 694 false "usages" as the ordinary word; इति counts only for multi-word sūtras — प्रयोजनम् closed ordinary sentences 39 times), and **Pāṇini-specific cues with a Brahmasūtra rejection — 33 of the first build's 34 numeric "Pāṇini refs" were actually ब्र.सू. citations and one was the Kāmasūtra**; bare `सूत्र` is an anti-cue in this corpus. The sūtra page's प्रयोगाः button now opens the grouped panel (snippets, sūtra highlighted, deep links; live corpus search as fallback). The reader's quick-jump resolver now matches data-side unit ids (DV_6001 …) — `unitId` carried on normalized shlokas — where before such deep links toasted "could not find that verse". **`.github/workflows/interlink.yml`**: any push to main changing library content rebuilds prayoga index + backlink shards + library status and commits them (trigger paths exclude its own outputs; bot pushes skip the job); the summary flags when the manual 330 MB search reindex (reindex.yml + CDN pin bump) is also warranted. **Notable data fact found while building:** Rukmiṇīśa Vijaya's folder exists but is empty (0 items) — the indexer will pick it up automatically once its text lands.
  10. **Instant word lookup (§5.1, done last):** the Shabdapatha sharded by first akshara (40 shards, `tools/build_shabda_shards.py`); `js/shabda-modal.js` shows the declension table in a bottom-sheet where the reader stands, tapped cell highlighted — measured 18 ms vs the brief's 100 ms target. Misses (kṛdantas, unlisted words) fall back to exactly the old shabda.html tab flow.
  - **Still open from the big brief, deliberately untouched tonight** (each needs its own pass and some need decisions): unified `reader.html` route + auto-pagination (§4.1); "where else" occurrence lists inside the word modal (§5.2 — the corpus-search link is there; a dedicated filterable occurrence list is not); §4.3 corpus-wide quick-jump abbreviations ("BG 2.47", "RV 1.1") — NOT built because each grantha's unit-id scheme differs (Ramayana is per-kāṇḍa folders, Gita per-prasthāna) and a half-right jump table that lands readers in the wrong place is worse than none; needs a small per-text alias→(slug, unit-pattern) map built text by text ("SMV 1.2" and the Ashtadhyayi box's "sk 350" already work); automated GitHub-issue correction pipeline (§6 — the mailto template is the shipped first block; see the triage-pipeline design note below); floating-toolbar/draggable-dock overhaul and library_manager modernization (§7); नामधातु/कर्मकर्तरि (above); Vedic chandas; recitation audio for chandas.

- **Ashtadhyayi page: the अधिकारः (adhikāra) panel was rendering raw data-format artifacts — "अनभिहिते$2$3$1" instead of "अनभिहिते" — on 3,467 of 3,962 sutras.** 20 Aug.
  - **Root cause**: ashtadhyayi.com's source (`sutraani/data.txt`) uses "$" as an internal field delimiter in several columns — its own `pc` (padaccheda), `an` (anuvṛtti) and `type` fields all follow `text$a$p$s` (or `##`-joined for multiple entries), and `importers/ashtadhyayi_layers.py` already parses all three correctly. Its `ad` (adhikāra) column follows the identical convention — the adhikāra text plus the adhyāya.pāda.sūtra of the rule that first states it, e.g. `"आकडारात् एका संज्ञा$1$4$1"`, and a sutra can sit under more than one at once, `##`-joined (`"...$1$4$1##कारके$1$4$23"`, 2,780 of the 3,467 cases) — but the importer stored `meta.get("ad")` verbatim with no parser at all, so every `$`/`##` in the source landed straight in the reader.
  - **Fixed at the source**: new `parse_adhikara()` in `importers/ashtadhyayi_layers.py`, mirroring the existing `parse_anuvritti()`/`parse_padaccheda()` shape — strips each `##`-segment's own `$adhyaya$pada$sutra` suffix, then rejoins multiple adhikāras with " · " for display (`"आकडारात् एका संज्ञा · कारके"`). Does not (yet) surface the stripped adhyāya.pāda.sūtra reference itself anywhere — unlike anuvṛtti's "‹ 2.3.13" citation, `row.adhikara` stays a plain string, so no reader-facing schema change was needed; the reference is simply discarded as noise for now. A real "which sutra first states this adhikāra, tap to jump" citation would be a legitimate follow-on, but needs the same source-vs-repo sutra-numbering realignment `tools/realign_sutra_enrichment.py` already had to do for anuvṛtti (this repo's sutra count and ashtadhyayi.com's disagree by pada, see that script's own docstring) — not attempted here, left as a real, scoped follow-up rather than guessed at.
  - **One-off cleanup for what an earlier import already wrote**: `tools/clean_adhikara_suffix.py` (documented, re-runnable, dry-run by default like `realign_sutra_enrichment.py`) applies the same per-`##`-segment stripping to the already-committed `dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/sutrapatha/data.json`. Also caught and fixed one genuinely different, much rarer artifact while sweeping every string field for a stray "$": sutra 6.2.142's **अन्वयः** (not adhikāra) carried the identical `$6$2$111`-suffixed pattern — `"उत्तरपदादिः$6$2$111"` — even though anvaya is sourced from a different column (`ss`) that the importer already reads correctly elsewhere; root cause not tracked down (single occurrence, not reproduced elsewhere), but showing raw `$`-digits to a reader is wrong regardless of which field it lands in, so it was cleaned the same way rather than left. Ran with `--apply`, then rebuilt `tools/build_sutra_index.py`'s output (only the per-adhyāya `sutra_detail_*.json` shards changed — adhikāra text isn't in the top-level `sutra_index.json`).
  - **Verified in a real headless browser**: swept every sutra's rendered HTML for the artifact pattern before and after — 3,467 → 0. Spot-checked 1.4.1 (single adhikāra), 1.4.50 and 4.1.1 (stacked, `##`-joined adhikāras — these two specifically caught a bug in the *first* version of the cleanup script, which only stripped the *last* `##`-segment's suffix and left the rest, including a literal "##", embedded in the middle of the display text; caught by re-checking a wider sample rather than trusting the first "0 unmatched" report, fixed by validating and cleaning every `##`-segment independently) and 6.2.142 (the anvaya case) — all render clean now. Full `./run_tests.sh` still passes (90 tests).

- **Sanskrit Wikisource Āyurveda importer — Mādhava Nidāna (1,554 verses/68 sections), Śārṅgadhara Saṃhitā (2,448 verses/34 chapters across all 4 khaṇḍas), Suśruta Saṃhitā Sūtrasthāna (2,142 verses/46 adhyāyas) ingested and merged; Caraka Saṃhitā deliberately NOT imported this pass.** 21 Aug. **Source & licence**: `sa.wikisource.org`, fetched via the MediaWiki API (`action=parse&prop=wikitext`) rather than scraping rendered HTML — clean, volunteer-transcribed text, not OCR, per this session's standing sourcing policy. Wikisource's standard licence, CC BY-SA; no per-page override found on any of the four texts checked. New `importers/wikisource_ayurveda.py`, wired into `dispatch.py` under a `wikisource_*` prefix (`wikisource_madhava` / `wikisource_sharngadhara` / `wikisource_susruta`).
  - **Each text needed its own parser — the wikitext structure differs enough between them that a shared one would have been fragile**: Mādhava Nidāna is a single mūla-only page with `==...==` disease-topic section headers (not numbered adhyāyas) and no interleaved commentary; Śārṅgadhara Saṃhitā splits across 4 khaṇḍa subpages, one `==...==` header per adhyāya; Suśruta Saṃhitā's Sūtrasthāna splits across 3 subpages with **no `==...==` headers at all** — chapter boundaries have to be reconstructed from two independently-incomplete signals (a bare `ऽध्यायः` start-marker and an `इति सुश्रुतसंहितायां...अध्यायः N` closing colophon), each missing on some chapters but never both at once.
  - **Four real parsing bugs caught and fixed before shipping, each found by checking actual output against the source rather than trusting a plausible-looking first pass:**
    1. Mādhava Nidāna: every section restates its own title as the first content line right after its header — bare, with a spaced "अथ " prefix, or (the case initially missed) with "अथ" sandhi'd directly onto the title with no space at all ("अथाग्निमान्द्य..."). Fixed by stripping all three forms before comparing against the section title, not just the two originally noticed.
    2. Suśruta: an early colophon-detection regex matched any line containing the ordinary word "इति" ("thus") that happened to end in a number — which is most verse lines, since a verse's own closing count is a number too. Tightened to require "सुश्रुतसंहितायां" (the text's own name) actually appear in the phrase, which real colophons always carry and ordinary verses essentially never do.
    3. Suśruta: some colophons write the "chapter" word as "...ओध्यायः" with neither the expected "अ" nor the elision-marking avagraha "ऽ" visible before it (an orthographic inconsistency in the source itself, confirmed on chapter 21's own colophon) — the tightened regex above initially required one of those two forms and silently missed this variant, leaking the colophon phrase onto the chapter's last verse. Fixed by matching on "ध्यायः" alone.
    4. Suśruta: colophons occasionally wrap across two source lines ("...विज्ञानीयो" / "नामाष्टाविंशतितमोऽध्यायः २८") — checking only a single raw line for the colophon signature both missed those as colophons at all AND emitted their second half as a spurious extra "verse". Fixed by checking the fully verse-assembled multi-line text for the colophon signature, at the same point (a VEND-terminated line) where a real verse would otherwise be committed, rather than as a separate single-line pre-check.
  - Every chapter/section boundary was verified against the source's own count before trusting the parser, not assumed correct because it ran without error: Mādhava Nidāna's 68 sections were spot-checked (2 false-positive "leak" flags from an automated scan turned out to be real verses sharing a topical word-root with their section title, not actual leaks — checked by hand); Śārṅgadhara's 4 khaṇḍas (7/12/13/2 chapters) match the text's known traditional structure; Suśruta's Sūtrasthāna reconstructs the exact chapter range (1–46) with no gaps and no out-of-range chapter on all 3 subpages, confirmed by diffing the parsed chapter-number set against `range(seed, end+1)` for each.
  - **Caraka Saṃhitā deliberately skipped this pass, not silently omitted**: its sthāna subpages interleave mūla verses with **massive embedded Cakrapāṇidatta Āyurvedadīpikā commentary** between verse markers (confirmed: the gap between the 1st and 2nd mūla-verse markers in Sūtrasthāna alone is 7,870 characters, almost all commentary prose carrying its own internally-renumbered citations) with no reliable mūla/commentary boundary found on inspection. Importing it as-is would mean either shipping commentary mislabeled as mūla text or hand-tuning a boundary heuristic with no confirmed-safe signal — left for a future pass rather than guessed at.
  - **Śārṅgadhara's one known, accepted imperfection, carried over from this text's design rather than newly discovered**: a short un-numbered caption/topic-tag line before some verses (e.g. "मङ्गलाचरणम्") is occasionally prepended onto that verse's own text rather than being cleanly separated. Unlike Mādhava Nidāna's section-title repeats, these captions are not simple title-repeats, so no safe general filter was found — accepted as a minor, documented imperfection rather than risking real content loss from an over-eager filter.
  - **Suśruta's other five sthānas (Nidāna/Śārīra/Cikitsā/Kalpa + the Uttaratantra) are NOT yet imported** — only Sūtrasthāna. Each has its own page structure that needs the same per-subpage boundary-signal verification this importer already did for Sūtrasthāna before being trusted (confirmed live: Suśruta's index page lists 14 total subpages across all sthānas, not just the 3 imported here) — left for a future pass rather than imported without that same rigor. The target folder is named `susruta_samhita_sutrasthana`, not `susruta_samhita`, specifically so this gap is visible from the taxonomy/library entry itself rather than only in this note.
  - **Taxonomy**: all three added as new leaves under `upaveda.ayurveda`, siblings of the existing `nighantu` subtree.
  - Verified live in the actual reader (headless, via `?path=`, working around `vandana-guard.js`'s site-root redirect with a `sessionStorage` bypass): all three grantha pages load with the correct verse counts (1,554 / 2,448 / 2,142 matching each importer's own output), correct titles, and clean first/last-verse text with no colophon leakage; no console errors from the app itself.

- **Kāmandakīya Nītisāra ingested and merged — 1,221 verses across 20 sargas — the genuinely new find an earlier session's research turned up, not on GRETIL or Sanskrit Documents at all.** 21 Aug. **Source & licence, verified live at import time (not assumed from the earlier research note)**: Jesse Knutson's Murty Classical Library edition (refined from T. Gaṇapati Śāstrī's 1912 Trivandrum Sanskrit Series text), proofread by Patrick Olivelle, published by UT Austin's South Asia Institute as an Open Educational Resource — a Google Doc, exported as plain text via `docs.google.com/document/d/<id>/export?format=txt`. The document's own header states **"is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License"** in full, unambiguous prose — the clearest licence statement of any source this project has ingested from so far.
  - **New `importers/kamandaki.py`**, wired into `dispatch.py`. Structure is clean and consistent: 20 `"<ordinal> sargaḥ"` header lines (only 20 lines in the whole 3,046-line document match that shape, confirmed, so the detection regex has no false-positive risk), verses marked `||N||`, verse numbers resetting to 1 per sarga (occasionally non-contiguous within a sarga -- e.g. sarga 1 skips from 13 to 15 -- an editorial-edition quirk, not a parsing bug, so the stated number is kept as-is rather than forced sequential). Several sargas carry more than one `"...prakaraṇam"` topic-heading subline mid-chapter (sarga 20 alone has two) — these are skipped as metadata, deliberately not treated as their own grouping boundary, so the grantha stays organized by sarga only, matching how every other multi-topic text in this corpus is handled.
  - **A real, silent-corruption bug caught before it shipped**: Google Docs auto-substitutes a "smart quote" (U+2019 `’`) for the plain ASCII apostrophe `indic_transliteration`'s IAST→Devanagari converter expects to mean avagraha. Left unfixed, "yo ’dhītavān" converted to "यो ’धीतवान्" — the elided अ silently missing, not an error, not obviously wrong to a quick glance, just quietly incorrect Sanskrit. Caught by explicitly testing the converter against a real sample verse rather than trusting the first plausible-looking output; fixed with a one-line `’` → `'` normalization before every `iast_to_dev()` call. Confirmed by direct before/after comparison, not assumed fixed just because the replace was added. A single inline `[1]`-style footnote marker (referencing a variant-reading note in the trailing appendix) is stripped the same way — apparatus, not text.
  - Taxonomy: added as a fourth leaf under `nitishastra`, alongside `hitopadesha`/`chanakya_niti`/`chanakya_sutra`. Verified live in the reader: correct verse count (1,221), correct first-verse text and reference ("Kamandakiya Nitisara, Sarga 1 · 1"), no console errors.
  - **Closes out the whole platform-issues + import backlog for this session** — Categories 1–7 of the original UI/UX request, plus all three outstanding content-import tasks (Cāṇakya Nīti/Sūtra, this) are now done. The one remaining item from the earlier acquisitions research, the Sanskrit Wikisource Āyurveda importer (Caraka/Suśruta/Mādhava Nidāna/Śārṅgadhara), was tracked separately as its own next task since it needed a genuinely different importer (Wikisource wikitext, not ITX/plain-text export) — see its own entry above; done as of the same day, with Caraka Saṃhitā the one deliberate exception (documented there).

- **Cāṇakya Nīti + Cāṇakya (Kauṭilīya) Nīti-Sūtra ingested and merged — 913 verses/sūtras across 25 chapters — sourced from Sanskrit Documents, per the sourcing table an earlier session already researched and left in this file.** 21 Aug. **Source & licence, noted per this session's own standing sourcing policy**: `sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/chANakyanItisort.itx` (339 verses, 17 adhyāyas) and `.../chANakyasUtra.itx` (574 sūtras, 8 adhyāyas), transliterated by Sunder Hattangadi; the site's own stated norm is personal study/research use, not commercial redistribution — no SPDX-style licence name, recorded as the site's own terms (same treatment this project already gives every other sanskritdocuments.org import). Both are genuinely distinct texts (confirmed, not a duplicate) despite the similar names.
  - **Neither matched `importers/itx.py`'s existing kavya parser** (`\section{sargaH N ...}` headers, `||canto.verse||` markers) — a new `importers/chanakya.py` was written instead, wired into `dispatch.py`. Chanakya Niti marks verses inline as `|| CH\-V` with no section headers at all; Chanakya Sutra marks adhyāya boundaries as prose (`"atha prathamo.adhyAyaH .."` / closing colophon `"iti ... adhyAyaH .."`) and sūtras as `.. N..`, whose *stated* numbers run out of sequence and repeat in the source itself (18 before 17, 21 twice, etc.) — positional numbering is used instead, the same convention core.js's own normalization already applies to every other flat text in this corpus, rather than preserving a source inconsistency into the data.
  - **Two real parsing bugs caught before either file shipped, not after:**
    1. The same `\-` explicit-hyphenation-point artifact `itx.py`'s kavya parser already found and fixed on kirātārjunīya (a LaTeX line-wrap marker, not real content) was confirmed present here too — chanakya_niti's own final verse read "sarvajanto\- reko" instead of "sarvajantoreko" before the fix.
    2. `s.startswith("atha")` for detecting a new Chanakya-Sutra adhyāya silently dropped adhyāya 8 entirely (7 chapters parsed instead of 8) — sandhi capitalizes the next letter ("athAShTamo" for atha+aṣṭama), and Python's `startswith` is case-sensitive. Caught by checking the actual parsed chapter count against the source's own 8 "atha...adhyāyaḥ" headers rather than assuming the first successful-looking parse was correct; fixed with `s.lower().startswith("atha")`.
  - **`importers/common.py`'s `write_grantha()`** now takes an optional `**extra` kwarg (e.g. `source_url=`, `source_note=`) merged into the written file's top-level keys, matching the shape hitopadesha's own data.json already had by hand — a small, generically useful addition so future importers don't need their own bespoke `json.dump` just to record where a text came from.
  - **Taxonomy**: both added as new leaves under the already-decided `nitishastra` section (`chanakya_niti`, `chanakya_sutra`, siblings of the existing `hitopadesha`) — schema `"generic"`, matching its siblings (not the more specific `itihasa_purana_text`/`grantha_mula_text`, neither of which fits a standalone didactic verse collection). `register_layers.py` picked up a genuinely unrelated pre-existing bug while registering these: it also flagged `vedanga/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/kaumudi_order/data.json` (a pure `kaumudiIndex↔sutra-id` lookup table ashtadhyayi.js reads directly, not shloka content) as a "new grantha" — registering it would have made it a clickable Library entry that renders garbage in the generic reader. Fixed at the root: a new `NOT_A_GRANTHA` skip-set in `register_layers.py` so it can't be re-flagged on a future run either, and the one bad entry it already wrote was removed from `library.json` before committing.
  - Verified live in the actual reader (headless): both grantha pages load with the correct verse counts (339 / 574) and correct first-verse text/reference; the Library modal correctly shows both under "Nitishastra (3)" alongside Hitopadesha, each carrying a real "NEW" badge (the very first genuine use of Category 1's lifecycle-badge feature on freshly-registered content, not a synthetic test).

- **Copyright: Mahabharata Kannada translation + Madhvacharya's Tatparya Nirnaya excerpts are now hidden from the reader by default, behind a super-admin toggle (Category 4).** 20 Aug. Investigated before building anything, since the ask ("hide original reference text, global toggle, secure backend remapping") didn't say which content or what "secure backend" was supposed to mean on an all-static site with no server anywhere in this codebase. Findings, confirmed with the project lead before implementing:
  - **The content**: `dge/data/itihasa/mahabharata_kannada/*/data.json` (18 parva files) holds a full Kannada Mahabharata translation (`commentaries.kannada` per verse, ~96,287 verses) plus Madhvacharya's own Tatparya Nirnaya excerpts interleaved after select adhyayas (`tatparya_nirnaya_excerpts`, 2,266 verses) — both extracted from a Pejawar Matha Android app's asset bundle. **No `license` field anywhere**; the only provenance is a foreword/blessing attribution, not a rights grant. This project's own standing rule (`PROJECT_BRIEF.md`) is "absence of a licence is not permission."
  - **The project lead's calls, both confirmed explicitly rather than assumed**: (1) keep the data in the repo, just stop rendering it, rather than deleting it — reversible, no data loss, easy to re-enable once/if licensing is confirmed one way or the other; (2) "secure backend" was aspirational language for a static site that has no backend at all — a client-side gate (stop serving/rendering the fields) is accepted as sufficient for now, explicitly NOT airtight against someone deliberately fetching the raw `data.json`, which would need real server infrastructure this project doesn't have and wasn't asked to build today.
  - **Implementation, gated at the single point every shloka's commentaries object is built** (`core.js`'s `dgeNormalizeGranthaData`, both its nested- and flat-items branches), not in the renderer: a normalized grantha object simply never contains the `kannada` commentary key unless `window.appConfig.showCopyrightGatedCommentaries` (new, default `false`) is on. Gating at the SOURCE rather than in `render.js` was deliberate — `render.js` is not the only consumer (`ai.js` reads `shloka.commentaries` directly to feed AI features, and the commentary-picker/search-scope dropdown are built from the same normalization pass), so a render-only gate would've needed repeating at every call site with no guarantee of catching all of them. Checked first that "kannada" as a commentary key is unique to this one source across the whole corpus (grepped every `data.json`), so gating by key name alone can't accidentally hide some unrelated, properly-licensed Kannada text. `tatparya_nirnaya_excerpts` was confirmed to already not be wired into any renderer at all (present in data only) — nothing to gate there today, just worth knowing it's not exposed via the UI, only via the raw fetched JSON (the accepted client-side-only limitation above).
  - **The "global toggle"**: added to `dge/js/config-editor.js`'s existing super-admin settings form (persisted the same way every other site-wide setting already is, `admin/config/config-overrides.json`, merged over defaults at load by `core.js`) rather than a public reader-facing switch — this is a rights/licensing decision, not a display preference, so it belongs behind the same admin gate as every other structural site setting, not exposed to every visitor as "unlock copyrighted content."
  - Verified against real production data (headless, intercepting the config-overrides fetch to flip the flag both ways): with the flag off, `availableCommentaries` never contains `kannada` and no sampled shloka's `commentaries` object does either; with the flag on (simulating a future confirmed-rights scenario), both come back correctly populated — the gate is real and reversible in both directions, not just a one-way redaction.

- **Fixed the actual "Rigveda View All crash" (Category 3) — found where the existing large-grantha safeguard had a hole in it, rather than assuming it was unhandled.** 20 Aug. `core.js` already forces single-view as the *default* for any grantha over 150 shlokas (a comment there already names the Rigveda-freeze case explicitly) — but that is only a load-time default, not an enforced limit: `render.js`'s `renderList()` still built one full DOM card per shloka with zero cap whenever `window.viewMode==='list'`, and the Display menu's "📜 Full List" button (`window.dgeSetViewMode('list')`) sets that unconditionally, bypassing the safeguard on a single tap. That is the actual reported crash — confirmed live: Rigveda Maṇḍala 1 (2,006 shlokas) opens correctly in single-view by default, but tapping "📜 Full List" reproduced the exact unbounded 2,006-card render. Fixed by making list mode paginate for real: a new `LIST_PAGE_SIZE=50` cap in `render.js`, a `Set`-backed page filter in `renderList()`'s existing per-shloka loop, and a Prev/Next pager (`#listViewNav`, styled to match the existing single-view Prev/Next nav) showing "1–50 of 2,006 (page 1/41)". `window.dgeListPage` resets to 0 on opening any new grantha (`core.js`'s `initApp()`) and whenever a search query changes (`search.js`'s `handleSearch()`) so a reader never lands on a stale page number from a previous, larger result set; a page number that's still out of range for a *narrower* result otherwise just clamps to the nearest valid page rather than erroring or showing nothing. Verified headless: switching to Full List mode on Rigveda Maṇḍala 1 now renders exactly 50 `.shloka-card` elements (not 2,006), the pager text is correct, and clicking Next correctly advances to shloka 51 as the first rendered card — no console errors at any point.

- **Library Manager (`admin/library.html`) mobile overhaul — and a real, more severe bug found while investigating it (Category 2).** 20 Aug. The ask was "decluttered mobile UI, filter section collapsed into a modal, icon legend in an on-click modal, admin filled/empty toggle." Screenshotted the tool at 375px width before touching anything, which surfaced something worse than clutter: folder **names were unreadable** — rows showed a single character ("ā", "ḍ") or a 2-3-letter fragment ("mis…", "ni…") instead of the actual name. Root cause: `.nm` (the name span) is `flex:1` with `text-overflow:ellipsis`, correct on its own, but each row also carried **six** always-visible `.ctl` icon buttons (▲▼📌✏️📁👁) plus a dot/badge/count — on a 375px screen those six fixed-width buttons left `.nm` almost no room before it had to ellipsis down to nothing. Fixed at the root rather than patched around: 📌✏️📁👁 (the four less-frequently-used actions) moved off the row entirely into a single "⋮" button that opens a small action-menu modal (`#actOv`, new) naming the entry and listing Pin/Rename/Move/Hide as plain buttons — ▲▼ stay inline since reordering is the most frequent action. Freeing four button-widths let real names render again. The other three asks, each straightforward given the page already had a `.ov`/`.ovbox` modal pattern built for its move-to-folder picker (reused, not reinvented):
  - **Legend → modal**: the always-visible `.helpbox` (explanatory paragraph + `▲▼📌✏️📁👁●●` legend) is now behind a small "ℹ️ Legend & Help" button (`#helpOv`), updated to describe the new ⋮ menu instead of the six inline icons it no longer has.
  - **Filters → modal**: the search box + All/Pending/Loaded/Hidden/Edited chips + Expand/Collapse all (previously wrapping across ~5 rows permanently above the tree) now live behind a single "⚙ Filters" button (`#filterOv`); a small badge on that button shows the active filter's name (or "filtered" for a live search) so a curator can tell a filter is on without opening the modal.
  - **Admin filled/empty toggle**: already existed as the "Loaded only"/"Pending only" chips — no new logic needed, just relocated into the filter modal above with everything else.
  - Verified headless at 375px: row names render in full again ("agama", "itihasa", "vedanga", …, only genuinely long names still ellipsis as intended); Legend, Filters, and the per-row ⋮ menu all open/close correctly; Pin/Hide/Rename performed through the new ⋮ menu write the exact same `dge.liboverrides` localStorage entries the old inline buttons did (spot-checked all three end-to-end, plus the pin marker 📌 reappearing on the row after pinning).

- **Commentary-available notification on Stotra/Veda pages (Category 1).** 20 Aug. Commentary/bhashya display is opt-in and hidden by default (`selectedCommentaryView` starts at `'none'` in `state.js`; a commentary block only renders once the reader explicitly picks one from the 💬 "Commentary Options" popup, `render.js`). A reader could browse an entire text and never discover real bhashya content sits right there for it — checked real data first rather than assuming this is rare: every one of PNS's 11 shlokas and every one of Rigveda Maṇḍala 1's 2006 items already carries non-empty `commentaries`, so this is the common case, not an edge case. New `dgeNoticeCommentaryAvailable()` in `core.js`, called once from `initApp()` right after `renderList()`: if `stotraData.metadata.availableCommentaries` has any keys, shows a one-time `showToast(...)` ("📖 Commentary is available for this text — tap 💬 above to view it."), gated per grantha (not per visit) via the existing `nsKey()` namespacing helper so it only ever shows once for a given text, never nags on repeat visits. Reused the app's existing toast mechanism (`utils.js`'s `showToast`, already used at 60+ call sites, including messages considerably longer than this one) rather than building a new notification UI. Verified headless: first visit to PNS (which has 5 commentary sources) fires the toast with the correct text and sets the seen-flag; a second page load never fires it again. One test-methodology note for whoever touches this next: this sandbox's local `http.server` is slow enough that `initApp()` can take 10+ seconds to actually run on a fresh load (confirmed via a MutationObserver measuring real fire time, not a guess) — a quick 1-3s `wait_for_timeout` in a Playwright test will miss the toast entirely and look like a failure that isn't one; poll for it (or just check the seen-flag/toast text directly) instead of assuming a short fixed wait covers page boot.

- **Lifecycle status badges on library folders (Category 1) — shipped what's honestly derivable from real data, documented what isn't.** 20 Aug. The ask was six states: Empty/Half-filled/Complete/Coming Soon/New/Updated. Checked what the data actually supports before building anything: `library.json`'s granthas only ever carried `path`/`populated`/`title` — no dates, no "expected total" concept, and this repo's own git history is a shallow clone (7 days deep, confirmed via `git log`), so a git-log-based "first added"/"last touched" date would be flatly wrong for the ~98% of the corpus older than that window (it would either show nothing or, worse, look artificially brand-new). Rather than fake three of six states, shipped two that are fully real:
  - **Folder-level completeness ("Half-filled"/"Complete" combined into one honest signal)**: every folder header in the Library browser now shows `count/total` (e.g. "आगमाः › पाञ्चरात्रम् › Pancharatra Samhitas 1/15", "दर्शनानि 52/237") when a section isn't fully filled in, or a plain count when it is — `total` comes from EVERY registered grantha under that branch (populated or not), computed once per `openLibraryModal()` call from the full unfiltered `library.granthas` list using the same grouping/hidden-path rules the visible tree already applies, so it lines up with an admin-moved or admin-hidden branch correctly. Deliberately does NOT start showing the ~548 currently-unpopulated leaves themselves in the everyday reader (that's a separate, real UX-risk decision — 32% of the whole catalog is unpopulated; flooding the browser with dead-end "Coming Soon" entries needs its own considered pass, not a side effect of a badge feature) — only the folder-level count changes.
  - **"New" (real, going forward only)**: `tools/register_layers.py` now stamps a real `addedAt` (today's ISO date) on any genuinely NEW grantha entry it appends — never backfilled onto existing entries, for the git-shallow-clone reason above. `library.js` shows a small "NEW" badge on a leaf for 21 days after its `addedAt`. Every entry registered before this change has no `addedAt` at all and correctly shows no badge, rather than a guessed one.
  - **Not built, and why**: "Empty"/"Coming Soon" as their own visible badge (would require exposing today-hidden unpopulated leaves — see above) and "Updated" (would need either real git history this shallow clone doesn't have, or a new manually-maintained per-edit timestamp — a process change, not a UI fix). Both are real follow-ups, not abandoned, just not guessed at here.
  - Verified live: real folder badges match hand-checked ratios (स्मृतिधर्मशास्त्राणि › स्मृतयः correctly shows 5/19, matching the 5 populated Smriti texts found during this session's own earlier investigation of that section); injecting a synthetic grantha with today's `addedAt` correctly shows the NEW badge, while all real (undated) entries correctly show none.

- **Fixed the reported laggy touch drag on the floating edit toolbar (Category 1).** 20 Aug. `dge/js/content-inline.js`'s `wireDrag()` (the super-admin in-place page editor's draggable bar, which the कोश/search fab drag above was deliberately modeled on) called `el.getBoundingClientRect().height` on every single `pointermove` event to compute the new position. `getBoundingClientRect()` forces the browser to flush layout synchronously, and since the previous `pointermove` had just written a new `el.style.top`, that flush was real, unavoidable work — done again on every one of a touch drag's many events (a touchscreen can report well over 60/sec), which is exactly what shows up as a finger dragging faster than the bar can keep up. Fixed by measuring the bar's height once in `pointerdown` (it cannot change mid-drag — expand/collapse is a separate action, never triggered while dragging) and reusing that cached value for the rest of the drag, plus batching the actual `style.top` write to once per animation frame via `requestAnimationFrame` rather than once per pointermove (a touchscreen can report events faster than the display repaints, so only the latest position before the next frame is ever visible anyway). Verified headless by instrumenting `getBoundingClientRect` to count calls made on the bar specifically while a drag is active: a simulated 40-event touch drag now makes only 3 calls total (one at drag start, two around release) instead of one per pointermove — and the bar still tracks the pointer correctly mid-drag and docks to the correct edge on release.

- **Floating कोश and global-search icons are now draggable to reposition and collapsible to a small dot.** 20 Aug, Category 1. Both were plain `position:fixed` buttons with no way to move them out from behind page content they happened to land on (a real complaint on the smaller/taller viewports this project targets) and no way to shrink them out of the way. New shared `window.dgeMakeFloatingDraggable(el, storageKey)` in `dge/js/utils.js` (loaded before both, so both `kosha.js` and `global-search.js` can call it right after building their own fab) mirrors `content-inline.js`'s existing edit-toolbar drag implementation — document-level `pointermove`/`pointerup` tracking (not element-scoped, and deliberately no `setPointerCapture`, for the exact same reasons that file's own comment explains), a 6px movement threshold so a plain tap isn't swallowed as an accidental drag, and a `justDragged` guard so the click that naturally follows a drag's pointerup doesn't also fire the button's normal action. Position is stored as viewport-fraction (`xFrac`/`yFrac`, not raw pixels) per button under its own `storageKey`, re-clamped on window resize so a saved position from a wider/taller viewport can't end up off-screen. Collapsing is a small always-visible "−" corner handle (a separate element from the fab itself, so it never fights the fab's own click-to-open or the drag threshold) that shrinks the button to a translucent dot at the same position; tapping the collapsed dot re-expands it rather than triggering the button's normal action (opening Kosha/search on a button the reader deliberately shrank would be a worse surprise than a second tap). Verified headless: dragging कोश-fab by (−100,−200)px moves it exactly that far and the new position survives a page reload; a plain click still opens the Kosha overlay normally after a drag; clicking the collapse handle collapses it; tapping the collapsed dot re-expands it without opening Kosha. Task #18 (the edit-toolbar's OWN drag being laggy) is a separate, not-yet-investigated item — this fab-drag implementation mirrors that file's approach but doesn't touch it.

- **Siddhānta Kaumudī's "4th item text is incorrect" (Category 7, content correction) — root-caused as a corpus-wide import artifact, not a one-off typo, and fixed at render time everywhere it can appear.** 20 Aug. Item 4 (sutra 1.1.4) reads "...तोतोर्ति । हलि च `<{SK354}>` इति दीर्घः..." in the raw data — a literal, unresolved internal cross-reference marker (`<{SK` + a number + `}>`) leaking straight into the visible Sanskrit text instead of being rendered as a citation. Not isolated to item 4: a corpus-wide grep found **1,373 of these markers in this one file** (`dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/paniniya_vyakarana/siddhanta_kaumudi/data.json`) and nowhere else in the corpus. The number is Siddhānta Kaumudī's own serial rule numbering (distinct from the `id`/`reference` fields, which preserve the original Aṣṭādhyāyī adhyāya.pāda.sūtra numbering this data.json's own item order follows) — a real, legitimate scholarly cross-reference, just never resolved on import. Checked whether it could be turned into a real clickable link first, since that's the better fix when possible: `dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/kaumudi_order/data.json` does carry a `kaumudiIndex ↔ sutra id` concordance, but it is **deliberately partial (1,105/3,962 sutras, ~28%, by that file's own `_readme`)** — not enough to make some of these citations clickable and others not without the inconsistency itself reading as another bug, and no way to fill the gap without an external authoritative concordance this repo doesn't have. Fixed instead by rendering every `<{SK(\d+)}>` as the conventional Sanskrit-commentary parenthetical citation abbreviation — `(सि.कौ.<Devanagari digits>)` — consistently, at render time in both places this data can reach a reader: `dge/js/core.js`'s `dgeSanitizeVedicAccents()` (the generic Library reader — this grantha is `populated:true` in `library.json`, so a reader can land on it that way) and a matching small `resolveSkRefs()` in `dge/js/ashtadhyayi.js` (the dedicated Ashtadhyayi+layers page, which doesn't load core.js). New shared `dgeToDevanagariDigits()`/inline `devnum()` (already existed in ashtadhyayi.js) convert the number to match this corpus's own existing in-text citation convention (e.g. item 3's own text already cites "(कट.उ.१.२.२३)" the same way). Verified live in both renderers: item 4 on the generic reader now shows "...हलि च (सि.कौ.३५४) इति दीर्घः..."; the same sutra's Siddhānta-Kaumudī layer card on `ashtadhyayi.html#1.1.4` shows the identical clean text. A final corpus-wide grep after the fix confirms no `<{...}>` markers remain unhandled anywhere.

- **Global search: real post-search filters — content type (shlokas/commentary), category, siddhānta, and a keyword refine box.** 20 Aug, Category 6. All filtering happens client-side over the ALREADY-fetched result set (`lastHits`, capped at the existing `limit: 30`) — deliberately never a new network round trip, since a fresh query is already the ~12-second multi-shard jsdelivr fetch documented in this session's earlier "Where else" fix; re-querying per filter click would only make that worse. `dge/js/dge-search.js`'s `search()` now tags every hit with a `contentType` ('shloka' / 'commentary' / 'prose'), derived from the grantha's own `schema` field via `dge/data/schemas.json`'s actual documented semantics (mula/vedic/itihasa-purana/smriti/stotra/dasa schemas → shloka; tika/tippani → commentary; generic/prakarana independent treatises → prose, honestly left out of the strict shloka/commentary binary rather than guessed into one) — a real, data-driven classification, not a title-text heuristic. `dge/js/global-search.js` builds a filter bar above the results (`buildFilterBar`, rebuilt fresh from the current result set on every new search so it never shows a stale chip with zero hits) with: a Type toggle (only shown when the result set actually mixes types), multi-select Category chips (from `hit.category`, already on every hit), multi-select सिद्धान्तः/Siddhānta chips (Advaita/Dvaita/Vishishtadvaita, derived from the grantha slug's own taxonomy path via a new `siddhantaOf()` — real signal already encoded in `darshana/vedanta/{advaita,dvaita}/...` and the separate top-level `dvaitavedanta/...` tree, not a new field guessed at — shown only when the result set has vedanta hits worth splitting), and a free-text "Refine within these results…" box (substring match against title+snippet). All four combine with AND logic via `applyFilters()`, live-updating a "N of M shown" count. Verified against real production data (Node-fetched via the same CDN-bypass technique as the earlier search fix, then injected into a real browser session through a stubbed `DGESearch.create` so the actual `open()`→`onType()`→`render()` code path runs unmodified): a 30-hit "आत्मा" search correctly built Type (शlokas 10 / commentary 20), Category (दर्शनानि 19 / Dvaitavedanta 10 / वेदाः 1), and Siddhānta (द्वैतम् 18 / अद्वैतम् 10) chips; clicking "Shlokas" correctly cut to exactly the 10 mula-schema hits ("10 of 30"); typing "ब्रह्म" into the refine box correctly cut further to 4 — screenshots confirm the visual result too.

- **"Where else" corpus search (Category 6) was reported as "doing nothing" — root-caused properly rather than assumed broken, and it was NOT the search engine.** 20 Aug. Verified the actual backend end-to-end first, since guessing at a UI fix for a backend that might be fine (or might not) wastes the fix: this sandbox's headless Chromium cannot reach the CDN at all (`ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` on every request — the same external-network block noted elsewhere in this file for GRETIL etc.), but `curl`/Node's own `fetch` CAN, so `dge-search.js`'s real `Index.search()` (it's explicitly Node-testable per its own docstring) was run directly against the live, pinned production index (`config.js`'s `searchIndexBase`, commit `3775f74b...`) from a plain Node script. Result: **the search engine and index are both completely healthy** — querying "विष्णुः" returned 10 real 0.97-score exact-word hits across Prakāśa Saṃhitā, Gītā Tātparya Nirṇaya, Bhāgavata/Mahābhārata Tātparya Nirṇaya, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Bhāṣya and more. It just took **12.1 seconds** (manifest + several postings-bucket + grantha-shard round trips through jsdelivr, all sequential network hops). `dge/js/global-search.js`'s `onType()` showed **zero loading feedback** for that entire wait — the results panel just kept showing its original "Type a word or phrase..." placeholder, unchanged, for 12+ seconds, then either real results or (silently, via a bare `.catch(function(){})`) nothing at all on any fetch failure. To an impatient reader on a phone, a static unchanging placeholder for that long reads exactly as "this button does nothing" — the reported bug, without the search itself ever being at fault. Fixed by making `onType()` write a "Searching…" state the instant a query starts (so the word-tool's "Where else" tap gets immediate visual confirmation something is happening) and a real "Search failed — check your connection and try again." message if the promise chain rejects for any reason other than the already-handled index-load failure (which keeps its own more specific message). `render()`'s existing "No matches." path for a genuine zero-hit search was already correct and untouched. Verified: immediately after opening, the panel shows "Searching…"; in this sandbox (where the CDN truly is unreachable) it correctly resolves to the existing "Could not load the search index..." message after several seconds instead of hanging forever on the stale placeholder. **Not fixed here, and worth a future pass**: the 12-second cold-query latency itself (a real UX cost even with honest loading feedback) — options worth exploring are more aggressive bucket-fetch parallelism, HTTP/2 request coalescing (jsdelivr already supports it), or a smaller/warmer first-load path, but that is a distinct performance task from the "looks broken" bug this fixes.

- **shabda.html: real 20-per-page pagination + Top/Bottom jump buttons, and the "source: ashtadhyayi-com/data" credit line moved off the page header.** 20 Aug, Category 5. The word list previously used a `CHUNK=250` "show more ▾" infinite-append (a single tap could add 250 more rows, including their collapsed bodies, to the DOM at once) — replaced with real Prev/Next pagination at `PAGE_SIZE=20` (`dge/js/shabda.js`), a page indicator ("Page N / 451 · 9,007 words"), and `↑ Top` / `↓ Bottom` quick-scroll buttons (`dge/shabda.html`'s new `#sh-pager` bar), matching the project lead's explicit ask. Deep-linking (`openById`, used by both a `#hash` and the word-tool's `?form=` exact-cell match) now computes which page the target word falls on (`Math.floor(pos/PAGE_SIZE)`) instead of chunk-loading forward to it — verified: linking to a word on page 3 lands directly on page 3 with that row open. **On the attribution line — deliberately not deleted outright, moved instead**: the project lead's request was literally "remove... source text," but `shabda.js`'s own header comment and `PENDING.md`'s existing Tier-A licence note both record that this data is used under **the project lead's own personal educational/non-commercial permission from the ashtadhyayi.com team**, not a blanket open licence — "Attribution travels in every layer's license field and in the branch README," per that earlier note. Silently dropping the only on-page credit for a permission-based (not openly-licensed) source is a real risk to that permission, not just a style choice, so rather than either ignoring the instruction or blindly executing it, split the difference: the credit line is gone from the prominent hero subtitle right under the title (the actual complaint — it read as someone else's branding on this project's own page) and now sits as a small, muted line at the very bottom of the page instead, still a real clickable link to the source. If the project lead wants it gone entirely, that's their call to confirm given it's their personal arrangement with the ashtadhyayi.com team, not something to guess at.

- **Shabda word-tool now opens an instant in-page modal instead of navigating to shabda.html in a new tab — and a kṛdanta (verb-derived) match now shows its real step-by-step Prakriya derivation right inside that modal.** 20 Aug. Category 5's ask was specifically "instant modal fetch instead of navigate+blank+scroll delay" plus "Prakriya integration in the modal" — the old `window.dgeOpenShabdaForSelection` did a full `window.open('shabda.html?form=...', '_blank')`, paying for a whole new tab, full page paint, and the entire declension-browser UI just to answer one word's lookup. `dge/js/ai.js` now builds a small self-contained modal on first use (its own scoped `<style>` block plus `.modal-overlay`/`.modal-content` from the existing shared modal CSS) and fetches `data/vedanga/vyakarana/shabdapatha/data.json` directly (cached in `DGE_SHABDA_CACHE` after the first lookup on a page). An exact nominal-stem match renders the word's meaning/gender/declension table with the matched cell highlighted, same as shabda.js's own view; a kṛdanta fallback (via the same `krtindex/` reverse index this session's earlier लभ्यः fix built) now fetches the actual per-root prakriya JSON and renders its real sūtra-by-sūtra derivation inline, not just a link — this is new, shabda.html's own kṛdanta redirect only ever *linked* to krdanta.html before. Both paths still carry a "View in full [...] browser ↗" link at the bottom for readers who want the whole page. Verified headless (mocking `window.getSelection()` to avoid needing a real mouse drag, since the modal-opening code path is identical either way — confirmed via the button's actual `onpointerdown="window.dgeOpenShabdaForSelection(event)"` wiring in index.html, unchanged): परस्य → पर's full table with षष्ठी एकवचनम् highlighted; लभ्यः → the real लभ्+यत् derivation rendered inline (screenshot); a nonsense string → the same honest not-found + report-missing message as before, now inline instead of on its own page.

- **Quick Jump input now actually navigates on a plain section/folder name, not just an abbreviation+verse pattern.** 20 Aug. `dge/js/config.js`'s `dgeParseQuickSearchQuery()` only ever matched `abbreviation+number` shapes (e.g. `rv1.1.3`, `pns5`) against `QUICK_SEARCH_ABBREVIATIONS` — typing a folder/section name like "kamasutra" or "mahabharata sabha parva" silently did nothing, which is what the project lead flagged as "functional Quick Jump" under Core Library & Data Rendering. Fixed additively, not by replacing the existing parser: `dge/js/library.js` gets a new `dgeFuzzyMatchGrantha(text)` that normalizes the query and every populated grantha's slug+title, requires every query word to appear in the candidate, and scores exact/prefix matches highest; `window.dgeQuickJump` now tries the existing abbreviation parser first and falls back to this fuzzy matcher only on a miss, navigating via the already-existing `dgeGoToGrantha`. Verified headless: `chandas` → `vedanga/chandas`, `mahabharata sabha parva` → `itihasa/mahabharata/sabha_parva/mula`, `nirukta` → `vedanga/nirukta`, `kamasutra` → `upaveda/kamashastra/kamasutra` (end-to-end navigation confirmed too), and a nonsense query correctly resolves to no match instead of a wrong guess.

- **Investigated the reported "broken Smriti folder formatting/indentation" — could not reproduce; most likely already fixed as a side effect of the field-name bug fixed twice earlier this session (PR #92, #99).** 20 Aug. Checked every layer a user could mean by "Smriti folder": the Library browser tree (स्मृतिधर्मशास्त्राणि › स्मृतयः renders shallow, 5 leaves, no compounding indentation — the compounding-`margin-left` hypothesis tested first was real for other deeply-nested subtrees like दर्शनानि but not for this one); the "Jump to a Shloka" TOC modal (clean numbered grid); and the actual verse-reader page for all 5 Smriti texts, covering both data shapes in this category (मनुस्मृति's nested `items[].shlokas[]`, and नारद/पराशर/विष्णु/याज्ञवल्क्य's flat per-verse `items[]`) — all rendered correctly formatted, properly indented verse text with no visible defect. All 5 use the `sanskrit_text` field that `core.js`'s `dgeNormalizeGranthaData()` only started reading in this session's earlier fix; before that fix these would very plausibly have rendered blank or garbled, which a non-technical bug report could easily describe as "broken formatting." No code change made here since nothing reproduces — noting this instead of guessing at a fix for a bug that may no longer exist. One unrelated, purely cosmetic data-quality nit spotted in passing and left alone (out of scope for this item): a stray double-space before some `।` daṇḍas in `manu_smriti/data.json` (e.g. "यथावद् अनुपूर्वशः  । अन्तरप्रभवानां") — cosmetic only, doesn't affect rendering. If the project lead still sees the bug live, a fresh screenshot from the actual device/browser would help narrow it down further, since headless Chromium at several viewport widths didn't turn anything up.

- **Live bug report with screenshot: selecting लभ्यः and tapping "Shabda" opened वलभी — an unrelated word — instead of an exact match or an honest "not found." Fixed properly, not just patched.** 20 Aug.
  - **Root cause**: लभ्यः (लभ्+यत्, "obtainable") is a kṛdanta — a verb-derived word — not a fixed nominal stem, so it correctly has no entry in the Śabdapāṭha database `findFormLocation()` checks. The code's own fallback for that case, though, was a blind substring search over every word's full text — and "लभ्यः" is a literal, coincidental substring of वलभी's own द्वितीया बहुवचन "वलभ्यः" (व+लभ्यः). One match, silently opened, looked exactly like a right answer.
  - **Real fix, not a workaround**: लभ्यः genuinely IS derivable — `tools/build_prakriya.py`'s per-root `krt` array already includes it (`यत्` on root 01.1130, लभ्). New `tools/build_krt_form_index.py` builds a reverse index the same shape as the existing tiṅanta one (`formindex/`) — surface form → {root code, kṛt type} — generating a deliberately small set of common surface forms per stem shape (documented fully in the script's own docstring: implicit-अ stems get ः/म्/आ, the ऋ-stem agent-noun type gets its own ऋ→आ nominative, genuinely indeclinable/irregular types are indexed only as their bare stem rather than guessing a declension that could be wrong). `dge/js/shabda.js`'s form-lookup now tries this index before giving up; a hit redirects straight to `krdanta.html#<code>:<krtType>`, which `dge/js/prakriya.js`'s krdanta view now knows how to open and highlight (same `#code:key` deep-link shape the tiṅanta side already used, extended to the other view). Verified live: लभ्यः now opens धातुपाठः › कृदन्त showing लभ्य/यत्/gerundive, expanded, with the real step-by-step derivation (डुलभँष् → लभ् → लभ्+यत् → लभ्+य) — not a guess, the actual grammar.
  - **The blind substring fallback is gone entirely, replaced with an honest "No exact form found" state** (search box left populated so the reader can still search manually if they want) plus a **"report this as missing" link** — a mailto: using the same pattern the app's existing typo-report already uses, but with a fixed, machine-parseable format: subject tag `[DGE-CONTENT-GAP]`, body a strict `Type:`/`Surface:`/`Context:`/`Page:`/`Timestamp:` block. New shared `window.dgeReportMissingForm()` in `modals.js` for pages that already load it; `shabda.html` (deliberately minimal, no modals.js) carries its own small inline copy of the same template.
  - **This templated format is the deliberate first building block for the project lead's separately-requested automated triage pipeline** (read a feedback inbox weekly, auto-fix and merge pure content gaps, route anything that reads as a functionality change to a human) — see the dedicated design note below for the full architecture and, especially, the safety boundary between what's safe to automate and what never should be.
  - Verified in a real headless browser: लभ्यः → krdanta.html redirect (screenshot: लभ्य/यत् panel open with real derivation steps); परस्य (the existing exact-match path) still works unchanged; a genuinely nonexistent string now shows the honest not-found message instead of erroring or guessing.

- **Design note, not yet built: a weekly automated content-gap triage pipeline, per the project lead's explicit ask — "think about how safely content-only related emails can be auto processed and pipelined."** 20 Aug. The immediate building block (the `[DGE-CONTENT-GAP]` templated feedback email, above) is real and shipping today; the scheduled read-and-act half is a genuinely separate, larger piece of work, laid out here rather than half-built under time pressure.
  - **The core safety question, taken at face value rather than assumed away**: an inbox is reachable by anyone, including someone who is not the project lead and does not have the project's interests at heart. A pipeline that reads an inbox and can push to `main` unattended is, definitionally, a remote-triggerable write path into the codebase. The project lead's own stated boundary — "any request to delete or change the functionality shouldn't happen automatically... post human approval" — is exactly the right instinct and the design below takes it further: **auto-merge is available ONLY for one narrow, structurally-verifiable class of change, and nothing else, ever, no matter how confident a classifier is.**
  - **What "safe to fully automate" actually means here, precisely, not just "sounds minor":** a report that (a) arrives in the `[DGE-CONTENT-GAP]` template shape (or a close sibling template — see below) with all required fields present and well-formed, AND (b) resolves to a **pure, mechanically-verifiable data correction** — a specific field in a specific `data.json`, at a specific path, changing from one exact string to another, where the fix can be verified against an already-trusted source (e.g. a GRETIL/Wikisource URL already in this project's accepted-source list) BEFORE it is applied, not just plausible-sounding. A missing Śabdapāṭha/kṛdanta form (this session's own trigger case) is a good example: the "fix" is either "confirm the form via the same reverse-index build scripts already in this repo and it was a build gap" or "it's genuinely absent from the source data, log it, do not fabricate one." Nothing that requires editorial judgment (which translation is "more correct," how to phrase a gloss, which of two textual variants to prefer) is content-only in this sense, even though it's about content.
  - **What is NEVER eligible for unattended action, full stop**: anything touching `.github/workflows/`, `admin/`, `importers/`/`tools/` behavior itself, taxonomy/schema structure, licensing/attribution text, or any file outside `dge/data/`; anything the classifier is not highly confident matches the template (default to NOT eligible, not to a best guess); anything a report's own language frames as a request rather than a correction ("please add," "please change how X works," "please remove"); more than one file touched by a single report; and by definition everything already called out above (delete/functionality-change requests) — those always go to a human, matching the project lead's own line.
  - **Proposed architecture** (not yet built, only the intake format above is live):
    1. A weekly Routine (`mcp__Claude_Code_Remote__create_trigger`, Sunday, this repo's environment) fires a fresh session with a fixed, non-negotiable instruction set — not a free-form "check the inbox and do what seems right" prompt, since that reintroduces exactly the judgment-call risk the template exists to remove.
    2. That session searches the feedback inbox (Gmail MCP tools are already available in this environment) for unread mail with an `[DGE-CONTENT-GAP]`-family subject tag, parses the strict field block, and classifies each report against the "safe to fully automate" test above — mechanically, not by vibes: does the referenced file/field exist, does the claimed current value match, is there a specific proposed new value, is there a verifiable source.
    3. **Eligible reports**: fixed, small, single-file diff; run whatever this repo's existing verification looks like for that data (re-run the relevant build/check script if one exists, otherwise a direct value diff); open a PR with the source citation and the original report quoted in full; auto-merge ONLY if that verification passed cleanly — never on classifier confidence alone.
    4. **Everything else** (including "probably fine but the classifier isn't sure," which per the auto-merge rule above is the default): open a GitHub issue, not a PR — quote the report verbatim, state the classifier's reasoning, tag it for the project lead's own review. Nothing is silently dropped; nothing is silently merged past this line.
    5. Non-standard mail (no tag, malformed fields, or anything that isn't this project's own template) is left alone entirely — unread stays unread, nothing is inferred from it. This is what "templated so Claude can ignore non-standard messages" means concretely: the tag is the ONLY signal that authorizes the pipeline to act at all.
  - **Not done in this pass, and why**: this is a real access-control system (an unattended process with GitHub write access, triggered by inbound email), not a UI fix — it deserves its own focused build-and-review pass with the project lead present to confirm the eligible-report boundary before anything can merge unattended, rather than being wired up as a side effect of an unrelated bug report. What ships today (the templated intake format) is real, working infrastructure toward it either way.

- **A large new batch of platform issues from the project lead ("resolve one by one till end, don't wait for my approvals... test thoroughly using screenshots"), worked through starting 20 Aug. First three: Dhātu Pāṭha "not loading", Chandas "missing from the library", Mahābhārata's Ganguli translation "not displaying" — three different root causes, all real, all fixed.**
  1. **`dgeGoToGrantha()` (`dge/js/library.js`) always opened `dge/index.html?path=...` (the general shloka-shaped reader), with no way to know a leaf is NOT shloka-shaped.** Dhātupāṭha's data is a root/gender/gaṇa list, not verses — clicking it loaded real data into a renderer with nothing to show, i.e. "not loading." Fixed with a small `DGE_SPECIAL_PAGES` prefix table redirecting to the leaf's own dedicated page (`dhatu.html`) instead. Found and fixed the identical, pre-existing gap for **Śabdapāṭha** in passing — it had no `taxonomy.json`/`library.json` entry at all, so it wasn't just mis-routed, it was completely unreachable by browsing the library (only a direct URL or the Explore popup could reach it); added both, redirects to `shabda.html`.
  2. **Chandas: `tools/gen_library_status.py`'s `item_count()` only ever read `data.get('items', [])`; the chandas vrutta database (`vedanga_chandas_vrutta_database` schema, 282 real vṛttas, shipped weeks ago per this file's own log) stores its content under six category keys instead, so it always counted 0 and stayed flagged `populated: false` forever — and the library browser deliberately excludes unpopulated entries.** Added a schema-aware branch; chandas now correctly shows 282 and appears in the tree.
  3. **The Ganguli Mahābhārata translation (16 files, 1,577 items, all parvas) is the SAME field-name bug already fixed twice today for a third field name.** `core.js`'s flat-items normalizer branch now also checks `item.text` (English-only "generic"-schema items have no `sanskrit_text` at all, since there's no Sanskrit line) alongside the `samhita_patha`/`sanskrit_text` fallbacks added earlier — confirmed live: all 1,577 items were rendering blank, root cause identical in shape to both prior fixes, just a third field name nothing had checked yet.
  - Verified all three in a real headless browser: Ganguli's Adi Parva section 1 (translator's preface) renders its actual English text; `window.dgeGoToGrantha('vedanga/vyakarana/dhatupatha')` and `('vedanga/vyakarana/shabdapatha')` both land on their real dedicated pages instead of a blank general-reader view.
  - **Given how many times this exact bug class had already surfaced today (samhita_patha/sanskrit_text/text, three separate occasions), did the audit immediately rather than deferring it**: swept every `data.json` under `dge/data/` for a flat (non-`shlokas`-nested) item carrying none of the four now-checked field names. Three hits, all confirmed correctly out of scope, not remaining gaps: `vyakarana_dhatupatha`/`vyakarana_shabdapatha` (fixed above by redirecting to their own dedicated pages instead of the general reader) and `kaumudi_order` (pure internal lookup data for `ashtadhyayi.js`, never opened as a standalone grantha). No further blank-render risk of this class remains anywhere in the corpus.

- **A batch of new-category clean-text imports, per the project lead's explicit go-ahead — sourced, licence-noted, and shipped where the pipeline is straightforward; three items deliberately held back and named here, not silently dropped.** 20 Aug. Scope, per direct instruction: "only target direct text of existing in any website. even if its licensed... I give my permission on all cases related to this. but note their source and license type for future reference" — no OCR-derived source touched this pass; every source below is an already-transcribed digital text.
  - **Shipped, all via `importers/gretil_bulk.py` (GRETIL, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 — attribution required, non-commercial, matches this project's established acceptance of GRETIL elsewhere):**
    | Text | Target | Source file (GRETIL TEI id) | Items |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Kedārabhaṭṭa — Vṛttaratnākara (mūla) | `vedanga/vrittaratnakara` | `sa_kedArabhaTTa-vRttaratnAkara` | 6 adhyāyas |
    | Vātsyāyana — Kāmasūtra (mūla, ed. Fezas) | `upaveda/kamashastra/kamasutra` | `sa_vAtsyAyana-kAmasUtra` | 7 adhikaraṇas |
    | Jyotirīśvara — Pañcaśāyaka | `upaveda/kamashastra/pancashayaka` | `sa_jyotirIzvarakavizekhara-paJcasAyaka` | 5 sāyakas |
    | Mīnanātha — Smaradīpikā | `upaveda/kamashastra/smaradipika` | `sa_mInanAtha-smaradIpikA` | 1 (flat verse numbering, no chapters) |
    | Nārāyaṇa — Hitopadeśa | `nitishastra/hitopadesha` | `sa_nArAyaNa-hitopadeza` | 5 sections |

    Plus **Yāska's Nirukta** (`vedanga/nirukta`, GRETIL `sa_yAska-nirukta`, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, 14 adhyāyas) — same batch, own commit/PR since it surfaced the critical rendering bug above; already merged.
  - **New taxonomy placement decided (was an open question in this file since 18 Aug), not deferred**: a new top-level `upaveda` section groups `kamashastra` and `ayurveda` (their traditional classification as Upavedas); `nitishastra` is its own separate top-level section rather than folded into `kavya_alankara` (which already held the Bhartṛhari śatakas somewhat awkwardly per the earlier note).
  - **Two real, general-purpose bugs in `importers/gretil_bulk.py` found and fixed while verifying this batch — not scoped to just these texts, they affect the WHOLE registry:**
    1. `split_header()` picked whichever of its header-end signals occurred earliest in the file, and `##\s*Revisions?:` (a changelog heading INSIDE the header) kept winning over the real, universal body marker every file in this corpus actually uses, `# Text` — so the line right after the changelog ("- 2020-07-31: TEI encoding by mass conversion...") was leaking into the first extracted verse of every SUFFIX-style marker (verse text, then its reference). A PREFIX-style marker's own first unit already starts after its own first match regardless, so this was invisible on Nirukta but hit Vṛttaratnākara, Rāja Nighaṇṭu, Vāhaṭa's Aṣṭāṅganighaṇṭu directly, and — not yet run by anyone — likely every existing suffix-style entry in the registry too (the 34 Purāṇa/Vedāṅga entries scoped 17-18 Aug, none of them shipped yet either). Fixed: `split_header()` now prefers the LAST `# Text` heading when one exists, falling back to the old heuristic only when it doesn't.
    2. Three marker patterns' "closing `//` is optional" idiom was written as `//?` (literal `/` mandatory, second `/` optional) instead of `(?://)?` (the whole pair optional) — so a file that dropped the closing slash ENTIRELY (not just wrote a single stray `/`) never matched at all. Hit Rāja Nighaṇṭu and Vāhaṭa's Aṣṭāṅganighaṇṭu directly. Fixed in all three affected shared patterns; confirmed the fix is a strict superset (still matches every case it matched before) by re-running the existing Purāṇa entries' dry-runs before and after — same item/unit counts, no regression.
    3. Nirukta-specific (not shared): its own section marker repeats before every sentence within one giant physical line, not once per real line break as the registry's own note assumed — confirmed directly against the source (18 true line-start matches in the whole file vs. the ref recurring dozens of times inline). Added an opt-in `strip_inline` regex, used only by this one entry.
  - **Confirmed, not touched: two pre-existing registry entries fail outright** (`skanda_purana_ce`: `bare_suffix` matches nothing; `vayu_purana_revakhanda`: `line_start` matches nothing), and **six śrautasūtra/gṛhyasūtra/dharmasūtra entries using `colon_prefix_sutra` also fail** (Āśvalāyana/Śāṅkhāyana śrauta+gṛhya, Āpastamba gṛhya, Jaiminīya gṛhya, Kauthuma gṛhya, Baudhāyana/Gautama/Vasiṣṭha/Vaikhānasa dharma) — all pre-existing, unrelated to anything touched this pass (none use the patterns fixed above), the registry's own error correctly reads "the file's format has changed." Not investigated further — out of scope for this batch, flagged for whoever next works through the Purāṇa/Vedāṅga registry.
  - **Deliberately NOT built this pass, named rather than silently skipped:**
    - **Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya** (Vāgbhaṭa) — GRETIL `sa_vAgbhaTa-aSTAGgahRdayasUtra`, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, clean digital text (not OCR, so within the approved scope) — deferred anyway because it's genuinely large (1.2 MB source, ~7,359 verses) with bare flat verse numbering that restarts per sthāna and no reliable numeric sthāna-boundary marker found on a first pass; doing it properly needs real chaptering work, not a rushed single-item import.
    - **Vātsyāyana's Kāmasūtra grouped only at adhikaraṇa level (7 items), not adhyāya** — the marker carries all three levels (adhikaraṇa.adhyāya.sūtra) but `group_items()` only splits on the first; finer chaptering is a real, scoped follow-up, not done here.
    - **Pañcatantra "confirm" dropped from this batch entirely** — turned out NOT to belong in this pipeline at all: the existing Pañcatantra entry lives in the separate Kāvya corpus/tracker system (`tools/kavya/config/works.json`, the `kavya-dist` branch), not `dge/data/`'s taxonomy/`library.json` system this registry writes to. Reconciling GRETIL's own Pañcatantra file against that other pipeline is a separate task or a false errand entirely (that pipeline may already have this text) — not investigated here, flagged instead of guessed at.
  - Verified in a real headless browser (`dge/index.html?path=...`) for four of the eight: Kāmasūtra, Rāja Nighaṇṭu, Hitopadeśa, Vṛttaratnākara — real Devanagari text renders, no console errors, no leftover markers. `tools/gen_library_status.py` rerun; all eight now show `populated: true`.

- **CRITICAL, live-production bug found and fixed: 805 already-published grantha files — 73,196 verses, including Śaṅkara's own Brahmasūtra/Gītā/Upaniṣad Bhāṣyas and the entire Dvaita Vedānta corpus — were rendering as blank verse cards for every real visitor.** Found by accident while investigating why the not-yet-run `gretil_bulk.json` registry entries (Nirukta etc., see below) would render once actually shipped; turned out this was already live-broken for content that shipped long ago, not just a risk for new content. 20 Aug.
  - **Root cause**: `dge/data/schemas.json` itself declares a different `primaryTextField` per schema — `samhita_patha` for `vedic_text`, `sanskrit_text` for `generic`/`grantha_mula_text`/`grantha_tika_text`/`grantha_tippani_text` and others — but `core.js`'s `dgeNormalizeGranthaData()`'s flat-items fallback branch (used whenever a grantha's data isn't shaped like `vedic_text` or `itihasa_purana_text`) only ever read `item.samhita_patha || item.sa`. Any grantha built on the `sanskrit_text`-primary schemas got `sa: ''` for every single verse — the reader app never had a way to reach the actual text, no matter how correct the underlying data.json was.
  - **This is the same class of bug already found and fixed once for `itihasa_purana_text`** (see the 9 Aug entry elsewhere in this file: "none of this schema had ever been wired into the main reader app's data adapter") — a different shape (flat items instead of nested chapters) hit the identical kind of gap.
  - **Verified against real, live production data, not a synthetic sample**: fetched `brahmasutra_bhashya/bhashya/data.json` directly from `tribhuvanachar.github.io` and ran it through the actual shipped (unfixed) `core.js` — **0 of 556 verses of Śaṅkara's Brahmasūtra Bhāṣya render any text on the live site today.** Same file through the fixed normalizer: 556/556. Also verified in a real headless browser against `dvaitavedanta/dasha_prakarana_granthas/vishnu_tattva_vinirnaya/mula` (opened via the actual reader UI, `dge/index.html?path=...`): blank verse card before the fix, real Sanskrit text + a readable breadcrumb reference after — screenshots taken of both states.
  - **Full scope, precisely measured** (not guessed): swept every `data.json` under `dge/data/` for the broken shape (flat `items[]`, no nested `shlokas[]`, has `sanskrit_text` but not `samhita_patha`/`sa`) AND cross-referenced against `library.json`'s own `path=` entries (the only way to know a file is actually reachable through the general reader, vs. e.g. Aṣṭādhyāyī's layers which have their *own* dedicated `ashtadhyayi.js` viewer that never goes through this code path and was never affected there). **805 files, 73,196 verses, all confirmed reachable via the general reader**: 745 dvaitavedanta files (the entire crawled corpus from PR #87), 52 darshana files (Śaṅkara's Brahmasūtra/Gītā/Upaniṣad Bhāṣyas, Tarkasaṅgraha, the core Sarvamūla prakaraṇa granthas — the flagship content this whole site exists for), and 8 vedanga files (the Aṣṭādhyāyī layers *also* have a `library.json` entry pointing at the general reader as a secondary route, in addition to their working dedicated page — that secondary route was also broken, the dedicated `ashtadhyayi.html` page was not).
  - **Fix** (`dge/js/core.js`): the flat-items branch now checks `item.samhita_patha || item.sanskrit_text || item.sa || ''` — purely additive, checked every already-working `vedic_text` grantha in the corpus (Rigveda, Samaveda, Taittirīya, …) uses `samhita_patha`/`sa` and is checked first, so nothing that worked before changes. Also fixed `vedicId` to prefer `item.reference` over the bare `item.id` slug (matching what the `itihasa_purana_text` branch already does with `chapter.reference`) — `gretil_bulk.py`'s importer already writes a real human-readable reference string per item; the id-only fallback was showing raw slugs like `DV_4827` instead.
  - **Why this went unnoticed so long**: nothing in this pipeline ever exercises the full reader-render step as part of import verification — every import session verifies its `data.json` output directly (item counts, spot-checked text, schema conformance), which is all correct and always was. The gap was one level up, in the adapter between correct data and the screen, which nothing had reason to look at until content built specifically on the `sanskrit_text`-primary schemas actually got opened in the live app.- **PR #88's Pages deployment verified live**, 20 Aug — fetched `dge/js/config.js` straight from `tribhuvanachar.github.io` and confirmed `searchIndexBase` is already pointed at the rebuilt index (`3775f74b...`), so the previous session's fix has actually reached readers, not just merged.

- **Word-click deep-linking, built for real — उवाच now opens ब्रू's लिट् प्रथमपुरुष एकवचनम् cell highlighted, परस्य opens पर's षष्ठी एकवचनम् cell highlighted, both from a single click on the reader's word-tool.** This was flagged as "genuinely large, not started" in the batch below; built and verified in a real headless browser, 20 Aug.
  - **Śabda side needed no new data** — `dge/js/shabda.js` already loads every headword's full 24-cell `forms` string into memory at boot. Added `findFormLocation(surface)` (a linear scan over the already-loaded data, splitting each cell's `-`-delimited variants and matching exactly) and `openByForm(surface)`, wired to a new `?form=` URL param that tries the exact-cell deep link first and falls back to the existing plain `?q=` substring search when the surface form isn't found in any table (so a word that isn't a declined noun/adjective still does something useful instead of a dead click). The matched cell gets a `.df-hl` class (`dge/css/dhatuforms.css`, same gold-highlight convention as global search's `.dge-gs-hl`) and is scrolled into view.
  - **Dhātu side genuinely needed new data.** The per-root prakriya files (`dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/prakriya/`, 2,230 files, 262 MB) have no reverse index — finding which root and which lakāra.puruṣa.vacana cell a surface form belongs to would mean fetching all of them per click. `tools/build_prakriya_form_index.py` (new, documented, re-runnable) builds one offline: `form -> {root code, key}`, sharded by the form's first Devanagari codepoint (42 shards, 12 MB total, so one click fetches one small shard — `dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/prakriya/formindex/0909.json` for anything starting उ) so it never costs more than one small fetch per lookup. 204,970 distinct forms indexed across 2,229 roots.
  - **A form can genuinely belong to more than one (root, key) — handled deliberately, not ignored.** उवाच is the documented example: वच् (02.0058) has its own native लिट्, and ब्रू (02.0039, which has no लिट् of its own) borrows वच्'s by the rule "ब्रुवो वचिः" (2.4.53) — Vidyut correctly generates उवाच under both roots. Rather than build a disambiguation UI the project lead never asked for, the build script keeps one match per surface form (first-write-wins, roots scanned in Dhatupatha code order so ब्रू 02.0039 wins over वच् 02.0058, matching how उवाच is actually taught) — verified this lands on the *more* useful answer here, since ब्रू's own derivation panel visibly shows step 8 as "ब्रू → वच्", i.e. the very substitution rule, rather than वच्'s own unremarkable native derivation. A genuinely ambiguous form can still occasionally land on the less-expected root for a given sentence — same class of limitation as every other automatic word-linking already shipped (sutra citation-linking, kosha lookup, etc.), documented in the build script's own docstring rather than silently assumed away.
  - `prakriya.html`'s hash format extended from `#<code>` to `#<code>:<key>` (backward compatible — a plain `#<code>` still opens at लट् exactly as before). A deep link opens the root at the right lakāra tab, opens that exact cell's step-by-step derivation panel (when one exists — Liṭ does, per the 19 Aug all-eight-lakāras rebuild), and gives the cell a 2.6s fading gold pulse (`.pk-deep-hl` in `dge/css/prakriya.css`) so it's unmistakable which of the 9 cells is the one that was clicked.
  - `dge/js/ai.js`'s `dgeOpenShabdaForSelection`/`dgeOpenDhatuForSelection` now build these deep links instead of plain `?q=` searches. Popup-blocker-safe: the Dhātu path opens a blank tab synchronously inside the click handler (preserving user-gesture status) and points it at the resolved URL only after the form-index shard fetch (or its fallback) resolves, rather than awaiting first and calling `window.open()` late.
  - **Verified end-to-end in a real headless browser, not just unit-tested**: simulated an actual text selection over "उवाच"/"परस्य" in a harness page loading the real `ai.js`, clicked the real word-tool functions, captured the real new tab that opened, and confirmed both its URL and (navigating there) the actual rendered, highlighted cell — screenshotted both (`shabda_form_highlight.png` showing परस्य's cell boxed in gold in पर's table; `prakriya_pulse.png` showing ब्रूञ्'s Liṭ प्रथमपुरुष एकवचनम् cell mid-pulse with the "ब्रुवो वचिः" step visible in the derivation below it). Also verified the graceful-fallback paths (a word with no shard at all, a word whose shard exists but has no exact match, a garbage form on the Śabda side) all degrade to the old plain-search behavior rather than erroring, and confirmed no regression to the existing plain `#<code>`/`#<id>`/`?q=` links on either page.

- **The search-highlighting fix confirmed live, with real screenshots against real data — and a real coordination gap with a parallel session's work, flagged rather than silently smoothed over.** 19 Aug.
  - Triggered `reindex.yml` after merging the `snippet()` fix; it published a rebuilt index (`3775f74b`) to `search-dist` successfully. **`js/config.js`'s `searchIndexBase` pin was NOT bumped automatically** — confirmed this is never automatic (the same trap this file already documented once today) — so bumped it by hand to `3775f74b`, matching the established pattern.
  - **Verified against the live published index, not just locally**: fetched the real rebuilt snippets for both originally-broken cases (Sumadhva Vijaya's tika commentaries, and Ashtadhyayi's tattvabodhini 1.4.36) directly over HTTPS, ran the exact shipped `centerSnippet`/`highlightSnippet` logic against them, and rendered the real result in a headless browser using the real `dge-normalize.js`/`global-search.js` (only the render/build functions temporarily exposed for the screenshot, nothing shipped changed) — कान्ताय now shows correctly highlighted, centered in a readable excerpt, in both. tattvabodhini 1.4.36 specifically: the match that used to be 618 characters past where the old 140-char snippet cut off is now present (781-char snippet) and highlights correctly.
  - **Surfaced, not created, by storing more text: a genuine encoding artifact (a `�` replacement character) in one tattvabodhini unit's source text**, now visible because the snippet is long enough to reach it — it was there in the data before this fix, just previously hidden past the 140-char cutoff. Not touched — guessing at what character was intended would be fabricating scholarly text, exactly what this project avoids. Whoever owns tattvabodhini's source text should re-check that unit against the original.
  - **Real coordination gap, worth knowing about**: a parallel session's still-open PR #78 already rewrote `build_search_index.py`/`dge-search.js`'s postings format (one file per trigram + document-frequency-based candidate selection, a real performance win — राम's query cost measured at 16MB → 549KB) and had validated it by publishing directly to `search-dist` (`f11a2e3b`). `search-dist` keeps only ONE squashed commit, not history, and this session's own `reindex.yml` run (checking out `main`, which does not include PR #78's still-unmerged code) overwrote that commit with this session's own build. **Nothing was lost that had reached readers** — `config.js`'s pin was still on the OLD `b726b5ec` the whole time, never `f11a2e3b` — and PR #78's actual code is untouched, safe in its own branch. But its already-published, already-validated index artifact is gone and would need rebuilding again. Documented directly in `config.js`'s own comment: whoever merges PR #78 should re-run `reindex.yml` afterward so both fixes (this session's snippet length + that session's postings restructuring) land in one combined index, rather than either being silently left out.

- **Both remaining items from the previous batch, built for real: Siddhanta Kaumudi reading-order navigation (partial, honestly bounded) and match-aware search snippets.** 19 Aug.
  1. **Siddhanta Kaumudi navigation — done, but genuinely partial, and here's exactly why.** Per the project lead's pointer, cloned `github.com/ashtadhyayi-com/data` (already had it from an earlier pass, commit `24109f7`) and found `ska/data.txt` -- Siddhanta Kaumudi's OWN text, in ITS OWN reading order (an `ind` field, 1-6481). Matched it against this repo's `sutrapatha/data.json` (3962 real sutras) by exact sutra text after normalizing spacing/punctuation: **only 1,105 of 3,962 sutras (27.9%) match.** Investigated *why* before shipping anything, rather than either forcing a bad match or giving up: (a) confirmed directly that many sutras' own words never appear anywhere in the 1.3MB Kaumudi file at all -- e.g. sutra 1.1.4's text is entirely absent, not a matching bug, because Kaumudi carries it forward through anuvṛtti (grammatical inheritance) instead of re-quoting it; (b) confirmed a real textual-variant issue too -- e.g. 1.1.7 reads "halo 'nantarah samyogah" in this repo's Kashika-based sutrapatha but "halo mithah slishtah samyogah" in Kaumudi, a genuine difference in traditional reading, not an error either source should be "corrected" to match. Tried a looser fuzzy+substring match too, out of thoroughness -- it only reached 42.5% and risked false positives on short sutras, so it was NOT used. **Shipped what the data honestly supports**: `tools/build_kaumudi_order.py` (documented, re-runnable) produces `dge/data/vedanga/vyakarana/ashtadhyayi/kaumudi_order/data.json`; `ashtadhyayi.js`/`ashtadhyayi.html` gained (a) a "कौमुदी-क्रमः" toggle that makes Previous/Next step through Kaumudi's own order among the 1,105 confirmed sutras (landing on an unconfirmed sutra and pressing next/prev jumps to the nearest confirmed one rather than silently doing nothing), and (b) a small badge on every confirmed sutra ("सिद्धान्तकौमुद्याम् क्रमः #N") visible in plain Ashtadhyayi-order browsing too, regardless of nav mode. Verified in a real headless browser: badge appears with the right number, toggling modes changes both the position counter and what Next actually visits, an unconfirmed sutra shows "not yet confirmed" and lands you on the first confirmed one instead of stalling.
  2. **Search highlighting root-caused all the way to the index build, not patched around client-side.** The earlier diagnosis was right that the pre-baked snippet often doesn't contain the actual match (confirmed live: a real match at character 758 of a 797-character unit, snippet was `text[:140]`), but a client-side "fetch the full unit and re-extract" approach was investigated and rejected: the corpus has at least 8 different grantha JSON schemas (`items` arrays with `id`+`sanskrit_text`, `shlokas` dicts keyed by unit number with an `sa` field, and others), and reimplementing that schema-awareness in JS would duplicate — and risk diverging from — `build_search_index.py`'s own `extract_text()`, which already handles all of them correctly since it's what builds the index in the first place. Fixed there instead: `snippet()` now stores up to 2000 chars (was a hard 140-char prefix) — sampled 1,011 real units across the corpus first to size the tradeoff (median unit is 648 chars, so this stores MOST units in full; long-tail commentary/purana chapters up to ~278K chars still get a generous but bounded 2000-char window, an honest partial improvement for those rather than a claimed complete fix). `dge/js/global-search.js` gained `centerSnippet()`, which slices a short, readable excerpt centered on wherever the query's own words actually appear in that now-longer stored text, before the existing highlight pass runs — falls back to today's plain-prefix behavior when no match is found in that script (e.g. an IAST query against a Devanagari snippet — a real, separate, smaller limitation, not fixed here). Verified: an isolated logic test confirms a match near the end of an 800-character unit is now correctly centered and included (previously impossible, since it never even reached the client) and old short snippets still work exactly as before. **This needs a search-index rebuild+republish to actually reach readers** (`build_search_index.py` changed, but the live index is a separately-published 330MB+ artifact on the `search-dist` branch) -- triggered `reindex.yml` via workflow_dispatch after merging so the fix goes live without a manual step being forgotten (the project itself already hit exactly that failure mode once this same day: a rebuilt index sat unreachable because the pin in `config.js` wasn't bumped after it).

- **A batch of five separate reports ("why are these failing again and again") — three real bugs found and fixed with live verification, two confirmed to be genuinely large unbuilt features rather than something silently broken.** Investigated each one directly (four parallel research passes) before touching anything, since a couple of these had been reported as fixed before. 19 Aug.
  1. **FIXED — global search's script selector was a native `<select>`** (`dge/js/global-search.js`), which draws its OPEN option list natively on mobile and can't be restyled — the actual cause of "not similar to the top menu's language selector." Replaced with the same button+popup-list shape every other dropdown in the app uses (`#dge-gs-scheme-btn` / `#dge-gs-scheme-pop`, self-contained CSS since this file loads on pages without `css/main.css`). **Found and fixed a second, unrelated, real bug while testing this one**: `open()` called `build()` on *every* search open, not just the first, so each reopen appended a whole second FAB/overlay/input/popup (duplicate ids, doubled listeners, unbounded growth over a session) — `build()` now guards on whether it's already run. Verified in a real headless browser: no `<select>` remains, the popup opens/closes/selects correctly, and only one of everything exists after opening search twice.
  2. **FIXED — the word-selection tooltip (Shabda/Dhātu/Where-else) never appeared at all for an ordinary reader.** Root cause: `dge/js/ai.js`'s `selectionchange` handler returned immediately unless `acharyaAuthorized` (an admin-tier AI-key unlock) was set on `document.body` — gating the ENTIRE tooltip, including the three word-tools buttons that need no AI and are this app's own structured-data lookups, not just the Ask Acharya buttons that legitimately do. `askAcharya()` already handles "no AI key configured" gracefully (a friendly message, not a crash) regardless of that flag, so nothing downstream needed it either. Removed the gate. Verified in a real headless browser: selecting text with no AI key configured now shows the tooltip with working Shabda/Dhātu/Where-else buttons — this is almost certainly the real explanation for "if I click on the word option... none of it is working," since most readers never set up an AI key at all.
  3. **FIXED — Kāśikā's own cross-reference citations, e.g. "(*७,२।१)", were never tappable**, even though sutra-number auto-linking (Issue 31/33/34, `dgeScanForSutras`) is already correctly wired into `ashtadhyayi.js`'s commentary rendering (confirmed — not missing, contrary to how it looked in the screenshot). The actual gap: the regex only accepted `.`/`।`/`॰` between the three number groups, and Kāśikā's own cross-reference convention uses a comma between the first two ("adhyaya,pada।sutra"). Regex now accepts a comma too (`dge/js/intellisense.js`). Verified in a real headless browser on sutra 1.1.1: both the sutra's own citation ("१।१।१") and the comma-form cross-reference ("७,२।१") now render as `.dge-sutra-ref` links.
  4. **PARTLY FIXED, honestly bounded — global search missing Sumadhva Vijaya for "कान्ताय" and not highlighting matches.** Tested against the real production index (live CDN fetch, not a guess). Found and fixed two genuine algorithm bugs in `dge/js/dge-search.js`'s candidate-selection stage (which shards get opened before scoring, not the scoring itself): (a) candidates were ranked by *raw* shared-trigram count, which structurally favors a long query's partial match over a short query's complete one — now ranked by completeness first; (b) boundary trigrams (`^ka`/`ya$`) are indexed against a UNIT'S WHOLE text, not each word within it, so a query word sitting mid-line (the normal case) could never match its own boundary trigrams even on an exact hit, permanently blocking it from ever becoming a candidate — confirmed as the literal reason Sumadhva Vijaya's opening verse (an exact, unambiguous match) never got its shard opened. Fixed by only requiring interior trigrams to clear the threshold. Verified against the live index: candidates that were previously invisible now surface (three Sumadhva Vijaya commentary hits, versus zero before). **Not fixed, and not silently claimed done:** "कान्ताय" alone is an extremely common word (a generic dative "to the beloved," live-index-confirmed present in 626 of 935 granthas) — no realistic per-search shard budget can guarantee any one of 626 legitimate matches ranks first; this is the corpus's actual scale, not a bug. Also found, separately: the stored phonetic key hyphenates compound words at their sandhi joins ("kalyana-gunEka-Dane") while a naturally-typed reconstruction doesn't ("kalyanagunaikadhamne"), so even the FULL exact phrase can miss an exact-substring/trigram match on a compound — a real, distinct normalization gap. And the "highlight the match" ask specifically needs the *actual* full unit text to build a snippet centered on where the query hit, not the index's own pre-baked first-140-characters-of-the-unit snippet (which is often nowhere near the match) — fixable either by rebuilding+republishing the 330 MB CDN-hosted index with match-aware snippets, or a new schema-aware client-side on-demand full-text fetch for just the visible results; both are real, scoped follow-ups, not attempted this pass given the size (an index rebuild/republish, or a new feature spanning several different grantha schemas) versus the rest of this batch.
  5. **NOT STARTED, genuinely large features rather than deferred bugs — flagged with what's actually missing, not just "later."**
     - ~~Word-click deep-linking to a specific inflected form, highlighted~~ **Built, 20 Aug — see the dedicated entry below.**
     - **Ashtadhyayi page missing Siddhānta Kaumudī-order navigation.** Confirmed: current previous/next only ever steps through raw Aṣṭādhyāyī numerical order (1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...); the Siddhāntakaumudī layer's own data carries no sequence/prakaraṇa-order field at all, only the same Aṣṭādhyāyī sutra id every other layer uses. This data does not exist anywhere in this repo and would need to be sourced from an authoritative Siddhānta Kaumudī edition before any "Kaumudī order" toggle could be built — not something to approximate or guess at for a grammatical tradition text.

- **"Meet the Founder" flashed the underlying shloka page and then stranded the visitor at the landing gate instead of back where they were reading — fixed by not navigating at all, and Contributors/Sponsors unified onto one config.** From the project lead's own description of the flow, 19 Aug.
  - Root cause of the flash + wrong "Back": `window.location.href` navigation to `home-panel.html?panel=tribhuvan` — closing the modal first repaints the underlying reader page for a frame before the browser leaves it, and `home-panel.html`'s own "Back" link had no idea it had been reached from a specific shloka, so it always went to the landing gate. Per the project lead's explicit direction ("what is the need of a full page link in the popup — a close icon is all you need... think and implement, don't keep asking"): **removed page navigation from this flow entirely.** "Meet the Founder" now opens `panels.tribhuvan` in a same-page modal (`window.openProfilePanel(key)`, new in `dge/js/modals.js`, fetches `admin/content/home.json` read-only) — nothing to flash, and closing it returns you to exactly where you were, because you never left. Root `index.html`'s own "Know More" sheets lost their "↗ Full page" link the same way (dead code once the point of a separate page — reachability — no longer applied); `home-panel.html` itself is untouched and still works as a direct URL, just no longer advertised from inside a popup.
  - **Contributors & Sponsors unified onto one config, per explicit instruction ("there should be one config... rendering in two places").** `admin/content/home.json`'s `sections[2]` had its own hand-maintained contributor list (Aniruddha, Sameer, "other sevaks") that had drifted from `admin/content/reader.json`'s `CONTRIBUTORS_CONFIG` (Sameer, Anirudha, Madhu, Aruna) — flagged as a real inconsistency in this file earlier the same day. `sections[2].items` removed; the landing page now fetches `reader.json` at boot (non-fatal if missing) and renders that section's list — and its new "Know More" sheet (`panel: "contributors"`, no `panels.contributors` entry needed in home.json) showing both `CONTRIBUTORS_CONFIG` and `KEY_SPONSORS_CONFIG` — straight from the SAME file the reader app's own About panel already edits. One list, two renders, no second copy to fall out of sync.
  - Verified in a real headless browser: clicking "Meet the Founder" produces zero page navigations and shows the correct panel content; the landing page's Contributors card and its sheet both show reader.json's live contributor/sponsor names; no `.sheet-fullpage-link` element exists anywhere on either page anymore.

- **Homepage tagline replaced, the Namaskāra button now shows a real blessing gif, and a real, confirmed bug in the reader app's admin edit tool — content-inline.js was wired to a page (`dge/index.html`) that never gave it anything to write into.** All from the project lead's own screenshots/notes, 19 Aug.
  - `admin/content/home.json`'s `brand.tagline` replaced with the requested short line ("Preserving Vidyā · Connecting Śāstra · Serving Paramparā.") — was a long descriptive sentence before, clamped with a "Read more"; the new one is short enough that the toggle no longer shows, which is correct.
  - The नमस्काराः · Salutations button on the vandana gate now shows `dge/images/guru/pranam-blessing.gif` (a devotee's sāṣṭāṅga namaskāra with the Guru's blessing gesture) in a dismissable overlay, instantly on click — no `src` in the markup, so nothing loads or plays before that click. Cache-busted per click so the animation restarts from frame one; auto-dismisses after one loop (~6.4s).
  - **The real bug behind "the Edit button isn't highlighting any of the text" on About This Project / Our Story: those two modals had zero `data-edit` attributes anywhere, and worse, `dge/index.html` never set `window.SITE_CONFIG` or defined `window.dgeContentRerender` at all** — the two things content-inline.js needs to actually apply a staged edit back into the live page. This wasn't cosmetic-only: it meant an edit to `SPONSOR_CONFIG.introText` (already had a `data-edit` attribute, added in an earlier pass) silently reverted to its old text after Save, every time, on this page specifically — the ci-bar and the per-field textarea worked, but the visible result never updated until a hard Publish + refresh. Root-caused, not just patched around: `core.js` now points `window.SITE_CONFIG` at the same object `SPONSOR_CONFIG`/`CONTRIBUTORS_CONFIG`/`KEY_SPONSORS_CONFIG` are already references into (so an edit to any of them is the same in-memory mutation), and `modals.js` now defines `window.dgeContentRerender`. About's intro paragraph and "Designed By" line, and the whole Our Story panel, now render from `admin/content/reader.json`'s new `about`/`ourStory` keys with real `data-edit` paths, so they're actually editable in place — verified in a real headless browser, including a live edit landing on screen immediately after Save with no reload.
  - **Our Story rewritten to the project lead's own replacement copy (19 Aug)**, restructured Why → Beginning (2021) → Growth → How it's built → Vision → New Stage → Founder → Guru/Ācārya gratitude → Our hope, ending in the Dharmo Rakṣati Rakṣitaḥ mantra. The founder gets one short closing section ("🪷 The Person Behind the Library") rather than the previous full personal biography (children, 2014 corporate exit, the 48-day sevā, the Archaka year, personal aspirations) — those stayed exactly where they already lived, `admin/content/home.json`'s `panels.tribhuvan` ("Gurus, Blessers & Inspirers"), reached via a new "Meet the Founder →" link. **That link fixes a second real bug in passing**: the old "Visit the Guru Paramparā" button pointed at `guru-parampara/index.html`, which resolves to `dge/guru-parampara/index.html` (a real page, exists) — but the project lead's intent, confirmed by their own wording ("the much more personal Gurus, Blessers & Inspirations page you already have"), is the OTHER Guru Parampara surface, `panels.tribhuvan`, standalone at `home-panel.html?panel=tribhuvan` (built in the Issues 24-43 pass). "How DGE Began" removed everywhere on the public site per instruction — the button, the modal header, and the top-menu label (`admin/config/menu.json`) now all just say "Our Story".
  - **Also fixed while in there, not separately asked for but the same root cause**: the ci-bar (content-inline.js's edit toolbar) now always names the file it's editing ("admin/content/reader.json", "admin/content/home.json", …) instead of only implying it through each field's dotted ci-path once you click something — a small, global step toward the project lead's separate ask below for admins to be able to tell where a section's content lives.
  - **Deliberately not built this pass, flagged rather than attempted: a dedicated admin-only "walkthrough" briefing which file/field each section's content comes from, across every section of the site.** The existing "Take the Walkthrough" (`dge/js/tour.js`) is a reader-facing feature-discovery tour (double-tap a word, the search box, …), config-driven from `admin/content/tour.json` — a different audience and purpose from an admin content-provenance briefing, and bolting the latter onto the former would confuse both. A real, separate feature worth its own pass once its scope is confirmed (per-page? per-section? a single reference doc instead of a guided tour?), not guessed into an existing system that wasn't built for it.
  - **"In the Know More Section of main page under Tribhuvan, my content changes aren't reflecting on the heading" — tested directly, the mechanism itself works.** Editing `panels.tribhuvan.title` via content-inline.js's click-to-edit and Save updates the visible sheet heading immediately in a real headless-browser run (staged into `window.SITE_CONFIG`, `dgeContentRerender()` re-opens the panel with the new title, both already correct before this session touched anything). Two more likely explanations, neither a code bug: (1) `panels.tribhuvan.title` ("Gurus, Blessers & Inspirers") is a field independent of `sections[0].name`/`blurb` (the "Tribhuvan Achar" card text edited earlier this session) — editing one was never going to change the other, by design, since the panel is about the gurus, not restating the card; or (2) the CDN-lag caveat content-inline.js's own Publish confirmation already states ("the live site... can take a few minutes to catch up"). Needs the project lead to say exactly which field they edited and whether they used Publish (vs. GitHub directly) to pin down which of the two it is — not re-guessed here.

- **A batch of 20 more issues (24-43), worked through 19 Aug, one at a time with real browser verification before each commit; a few flagged here rather than silently claimed done.**
  - Issues 25, 42, 24, 35, 43, 37, 38: real, reproducible bugs found and fixed (support-button visibility race; Library Manager's stale post-move fetch path; the edit tool's fixed position and its highlight leaking onto the landing page's own vandana verse; the audio player auto-playing on shloka click/filter and its track counter going stale; the Dhatu->Ashtadhyayi sutra deep-link and the Ashtadhyayi jump box requiring Enter). Each has its own commit with the real headless-browser verification in the message.
  - **Issue 39 (`?SMV=1.2` query routing "fails to route") — investigated, and the routing code itself is correct, not the bug.** Verified end-to-end in a real headless browser (offer -> Enter -> `dge/index.html?SMV=1.2` correctly opens Sumadhva Vijaya sarga 1 shloka 2) once external CDN requests are prevented from interfering. The real, reproducible failure: `jszip.min.js` loaded as a plain blocking `<script>` tag (cdnjs.cloudflare.com) with no `async`/`defer` — a *hung* request (not a failed one; `onerror` never fires on a stall) blocks the whole parser forever, and core.js's own boot (which runs the SMV routing) sits after it in document order. Fixed for jszip (on-demand only, already guarded by `typeof JSZip==='undefined'` checks, so async costs nothing) and confirmed the fix directly by forcing that exact resource to hang. **Not fixed, and worth its own pass:** `sanscript.js` carries the identical structural risk across every page that loads it (dhatu.html, ashtadhyayi.html, kavya.html, prakriya.html, krdanta.html, dhatuforms.html, shabda.html, both index.html's, ...) — already has an `onerror`-based CDN fallback (jsDelivr -> unpkg) but that doesn't help a hang either, and touching it safely means checking each of those pages' own use of `window.Sanscript`, not a single-file fix like jszip was.
  - **Issues 26, 28, 29, 30, 31/33/34, 32, 36, 41 — done, each with its own commit and real headless-browser verification** (site footer + Contact Us + robots.txt anti-crawler rules + copy-guard friction; Know More panels split into standalone admin-editable pages; word-tool popup's Shabda/Dhātu/corpus-search actions; sutra auto-linking + keyword highlighting wired into global-search and Kosha; base styling for unstyled text/select boxes on the Vyakaraṇa pages; Kosha Cleared/Unclear status gated behind the existing admin check; Dhātu filter-panel collapse and the sources disclosure hiding Vidyut/API plumbing from end users).
  - **Issue 27 (name+language onboarding, global language threading) — done, scoped.** New first-visit popup (`dge/js/onboarding.js`, shown once via `dge_onboarded` in localStorage, "Skip" always available) collects an optional name and a language choice (English/Kannada/Sanskrit), then: (a) applies a matching default display script via the existing `window.setScript()` — Kannada→kannada script, Sanskrit→devanagari, English→iast, all still freely changeable afterward from the display menu exactly as before; (b) is read by `ai.js`'s new `dgeLangInstruction()` and appended to `window.acharyaSystemPrompt`, so every Ask Acharya reply on the main reader follows it; (c) also seeds `ashtadhyayi.js`'s own separate `aiLang` (that page never used the centralized `acharyaSystemPrompt` — it builds its own Gemini prompt — so it needed its own read of the same `dge_lang_pref` key, done at boot, still overridable by that page's own language buttons). **Deliberately NOT done, flagged rather than guessed at:** translating the site's menu/heading UI strings themselves — there is no i18n system anywhere in this codebase (checked; confirmed absent), and machine-translating every label without native-speaker review risks shipping visibly wrong Kannada/Sanskrit UI text, which is worse than leaving it in English. Also not done: "sorting mechanisms... according to Kannada" (e.g. Kannada alphabetical collation) — needs a real locale-aware comparator per data type (words currently sort with plain `.localeCompare(..., "sa")` in a couple of places, e.g. shabda.js), not investigated this pass, and wrong ordering would be a silent, hard-to-notice correctness bug rather than an obviously-broken one. Both are real open items, not silently dropped — worth their own pass once there's a concrete list of user-facing strings to translate and confirmation from a Kannada speaker on the intended sort order.
  - **Issue 40 (What's New auto-logging + manual admin editing) — deferred, not started.** Manual admin editing of "What's New" already exists via the same content-inline system every other admin-editable field uses; the missing half is auto-logging each build/deploy's changes into it, which needs a decision on what "auto" means here first (this repo has no CI pipeline step of its own — it's a plain GitHub Pages build — so "auto" would mean either a commit-message-driven script run locally before each push, or a GitHub Action added to the repo). Flagging for the project lead's call on the mechanism rather than picking one unilaterally, since it changes the deploy process itself, not just app code.
  - **Sponsor/contributor data lives in two separate places that can drift out of sync — flagged for the project lead's decision, not merged unilaterally.** `admin/content/home.json`'s `sections[2]` ("Contributors & Seva Support", shown in the homepage's own preview/"Know More" panel) and `dge/index.html`'s `SPONSOR_CONFIG`/`CONTRIBUTORS_CONFIG`/`KEY_SPONSORS_CONFIG` (shown in the reader's own sponsor modal) are two independently-editable copies of what should be the same list. Issue 28 already asked for "a single global file" for exactly this; not done here because picking which of the two shapes becomes canonical, and migrating the other page to read from it, is a real content decision (whose names/order win when they currently disagree) that the project lead should make, not something to guess silently correct.

- **ashtadhyayi-com/data investigated for what could fill the Dhatupatha's known gaps (seT/aniT, kṛt/karma, ādivarṇa/antyavarṇa, anubandha) — one gap closed for real, the rest scoped and left as an explicit numbered list, not silently dropped.** Cloned `github.com/ashtadhyayi-com/data` (commit `24109f7`; README: "free to use... provided that appropriate credits are mentioned") and checked its actual contents rather than assuming from the name:
  1. **seṭ/aniṭ (iṭ-augment) and sakarmaka/akarmaka/dvikarmaka (transitivity) — done, merged.** `dhatu/data.txt`'s `settva`/`karma` fields, keyed by the same `baseindex` this repo already uses as `id`, matched all 2229 local roots 1:1 — no inference, no partial coverage. `tools/merge_dhatu_classification.py` merges them plus Hindi/English glosses (`artha_extra`) into `dhatupatha/data.json`; `dhatu.html`/`dhatu.js` re-enable the previously-disabled seT/aniṭ chips (a veṭ chip too, since the source distinguishes it — 41 roots) and add a new कर्म filter row. Verified in a real headless browser: filter counts match the source exactly (seṭ 1882/aniṭ 306/veṭ 41, सकर्मक 1553/अकर्मक 653/द्विकर्मक 23), and a root's expanded body shows all three correctly. Adds ~300 KB to `data.json` (928 KB total) — trivial against the site's size budget.
  2. **आदिवर्ण/अन्त्यवर्ण (initial/final letter classification) — not merged; not needed as an import.** Neither this source nor vidyut's own data carries it as an explicit field, but it doesn't need to be: it's mechanically derivable from each root's own `dhatu_slp` (already in `data.json`) once real SLP1 anubandha-stripping rules exist — see next item. Not implemented this pass because that stripping logic is the actual blocker, not missing data.
  3. **अनुबन्ध (IT-marker) classification — not merged, genuinely blocked.** Not an explicit field anywhere checked (this source's `krut/pratyay.txt` has `it1`/`it2`/`it3` columns for kṛt-pratyayas specifically, not dhātu upadeśa anubandhas). Doing this correctly needs real Paninian anubandha-stripping rules applied to the SLP1 upadeśa string (e.g. `eDa~\\` → strip the trailing accent+anunāsika markers to get the bare root) — naive string-slicing was already flagged elsewhere in this project as unsafe for exactly this reason. Worth a dedicated pass, ideally reusing vidyut-prakriya's own internal rules (it already parses these upadeśas correctly to run derivations) rather than reimplementing them.
  4. **उदात्त/अनुदात्त (accent) — partial signal only, not merged.** `dhatu/data.txt`'s free-text `tags` field sometimes includes "उदात्तोपदेशः" but isn't a clean enum and isn't populated for every root — lower confidence than `settva`/`karma`, deferred rather than shipped as an unreliable filter.
  5. ~~**Verb-form tables (लुङन्त, यङ्लुङन्त, सन्नन्त, णिजन्त, कर्मणि, कर्तरि — Issue 15's "Dhātu Bodha" ask) — available, deliberately deferred.**~~ **Done — imported, the project lead explicitly lifted the 1 GB caution ("let any import whatever size, may be done... we will later on push it to another repository if performance issue arises... 1GB is just a recommendation, 5GB[+] is the real ceiling").** `tools/build_dhatu_forms.py` builds one JSON per root (`data/vedanga/vyakarana/dhatuforms/<code>.json`, 2229 files, 105 MB) from 9 of the 10 `dhatuforms_vidyut_*.txt` tables — shuddha karmani, san/nich/yang/yangluk × kartari/karmani. **shuddha kartari is deliberately excluded**: `data/vedanga/vyakarana/prakriya/<gana>/<code>.json` (built by `tools/build_prakriya.py` from vidyut-prakriya itself, no external dependency) already derives that exact table with its full step-by-step derivation, and `prakriya.html` already shows it — importing a second, independently-generated copy would risk the two silently disagreeing on some root with no way for a reader to tell which is right, not just cost bytes. New page `dhatuforms.html`/`js/dhatuforms.js` (linked from a dhatu row's "रूपाणि · सन्/णिच्/यङ्" button) renders voice tabs × 10-lakāra buttons × a 3×3 person/number table; degrades cleanly to 5 tabs for the 447 roots without yaṅ/yaṅluk forms (checked against source counts: yaṅ/yaṅluk 1782/2229, everything else 2229/2229). Verified in a real headless browser: bhū (01.0001, has all 9 tabs) and 01.0002 (5 tabs, no yaṅ) both render correct tables across voice and lakāra switches. Site working tree now ~1.1 GB (was 992 MB) — over the documented GitHub Pages "published site may be no larger than 1 GB" line, a real ceiling stated in Pages' own docs, not just the general repo-size recommendation; the project lead was told this explicitly and chose to proceed, with a split-to-another-repo fallback already agreed if it causes real problems. Worth watching the next Pages deploy to confirm it actually builds past 1 GB rather than assuming it will. **Confirmed 19 Aug 2026: it does.** With the working tree at 1,080 MB, the published site serves `dge/data/dvaitavedanta/later_acharyas/nyaya_sudha/mula/data.json` (2.68 MB) and a `library.json` carrying all 46 of its entries, both HTTP 200 from `tribhuvanachar.github.io/bhumandala`. So the 1 GB line is a recommendation Pages does not enforce at this size, exactly as the project lead judged.
  6. ~~**Śabda-side data (declension tables, meanings — the other half of Issue 15/19's ask) — available, not evaluated for import yet.**~~ **Done — declension tables imported; the meanings blob deliberately left out.** `tools/build_shabdapatha.py` builds `data/vedanga/vyakarana/shabdapatha/data.json` (one combined file, 9007 words, 7.96 MB) from `shabda/data2.txt` — word, liṅga, three short glosses (Sanskrit/Hindi/English), and the 24-cell (8 vibhakti × 3 vacana) declension table. New `shabda.html`/`js/shabda.js` (mirrors `dhatu.js`'s list/filter/expand shape) browse/search/filter-by-gender and expand a word into its full declension table; linked from the homepage's Explore popup as "🔤 Śabdapāṭha". `shabda/shabda_meanings.txt` (15 MB, a bundled multi-dictionary gloss blob — Apte Hindi/English, MW, Bhargava, several headwords stacked under one key) was deliberately **not** merged: it overlaps in purpose with this repo's own Kosha module (`js/kosha.js`, `data/kosha/*`, already shipping Shabdakalpadruma etc.), and folding a second, differently-shaped dictionary source into Kosha wants its own scoping pass against Kosha's existing schema, not a rushed merge here. Verified in a real headless browser: gender-filter counts match the source (स्त्री 2108/9007), search narrows correctly, and two different words' (अकूपार, पुं; अकरणि, स्त्री) declension tables render with the right forms including multi-option cells (e.g. पञ्चमी twin forms). Caught and fixed a real bug of my own while testing: the row's DOM `id` attribute was built with `CSS.escape()` (meant only for building a *selector* string, not a literal attribute value) instead of plain text, so any word whose `urlid` needed escaping (e.g. `@akUpAra1`) got a mismatched id/selector pair and its row silently failed to expand — first caught because clicking a real search result produced an empty body, not because of a code read.
  7. **kṛt-pratyaya IT-marker/prakṛti data** — `krut/pratyay.txt` (24 KB) and `krut/prakruti.txt` (56 KB) exist and are small, but nothing in the current 23-issue list names a kṛt-pratyaya catalog feature this would feed — noted for whenever that's actually asked for, not built speculatively.

- **Three more admin-panel reports, all investigated this session
  (`dge/js/admin-editor.js` → v1.19, `dge/js/content-editor.js` → v1.3).
  One fully fixed, one fixed as a real feature gap, one only partially
  diagnosed — flagged honestly below rather than claimed as solved.**
  1. **RESOLVED (messaging, not a bug) — "edited PNS, saved, refreshed,
     still saw old text, but the admin file browser shows the right
     data.json."** This is almost certainly GitHub Pages' own CDN, not
     this app's caching: the site is served from
     `tribhuvanachar.github.io/bhumandala/dge/` (confirmed in
     `PROJECT_STATUS.md`), and GitHub Pages caches responses at its edge
     for a few minutes independent of anything the app does — the commit
     itself is real and immediate (which is exactly why the admin file
     browser, which reads straight from the GitHub API, already showed
     the correct text), but the *live* site can lag behind it briefly.
     Couldn't verify this against the actual production CDN from this
     sandbox (no reachable deployment here), so this is a strong
     diagnosis, not a confirmed one. Since there's no way to control GH
     Pages' Cache-Control headers from a plain Pages site, fixed the
     part that's actually fixable: `dgePushContentEdits`'s success alert
     now says this explicitly, so a refresh showing old text right after
     a push doesn't read as a failed save.
  2. **PARTIALLY INVESTIGATED, not confirmed fixed — admin file browser:
     "edited+saved PNS, navigated folders to Raghavendra Vijaya sarga_1,
     clicked its data.json, still saw PNS's old content until I manually
     closed the editor and reopened it."** Read through
     `dgeAdminOpenFile`, `dgeAdminNavigate`, `dgeAdminRowClick`, and
     `dgeAdminSaveFile` closely — structurally all four look correct
     (fresh cache-busted fetch every open, textarea cleared synchronously
     before the fetch, save closes the editor and resets its state,
     selection is cleared on every navigate, row click handlers get
     fresh path/name values from the current render with no stale
     closures). Could not reproduce live to confirm or rule out a
     specific cause — the repo is private and this session has no GitHub
     token, so even a read-only `dgeGithubListDir`/`dgeGithubGetFile`
     call fails here. Added a real hardening fix regardless of exact
     root cause: `dgeAdminOpenFile` now carries a per-call request ID
     (`dgeAdminOpenFileRequestId`), so if an earlier file's fetch somehow
     resolves after a later one has already started, its response is
     discarded instead of overwriting the textarea — a defensive fix for
     any race-condition variant of this symptom, not a confirmed cure
     for this specific report. If it recurs, worth noting whether any
     checkboxes were selected at the time (the one remaining code path
     that could plausibly swallow a row click without visibly failing).
  3. **RESOLVED — admin panel's "Recent Activity" Undo only ever worked
     on the single most recent commit; undoing anything older forced
     undoing every commit after it too, even when those were completely
     unrelated files.** Real, valid complaint — admin-panel commits are
     frequently unrelated single-file edits, and the project lead was
     right that they shouldn't have to unwind unrelated later changes
     just to revert one earlier one. Replaced `dgeAdminUndoLastCommit`
     (which only worked by resetting the tree to the target commit's own
     parent — correct only when that commit IS the current tip) with
     `dgeAdminUndoCommit(commitSha)`, a real per-commit revert: diffs the
     target commit against its own immediate parent to find exactly
     which paths IT changed (via two full recursive-tree fetches, not
     GitHub's Compare API, to avoid relying on its less-precise added/
     removed/modified semantics), then applies the inverse of just those
     paths on top of the CURRENT head tree via a partial tree update
     (`base_tree` + only the changed entries) — any commits before or
     after that touched OTHER files are left completely alone, which is
     the actual fix. Also detects genuine conflicts: if some later commit
     already touched one of the same paths again, that path is skipped
     (reported by name to the admin) rather than silently clobbering the
     later edit — matches what `git revert` itself would flag as a
     conflict rather than silently resolving. Every entry in Recent
     Activity now gets its own working "↩️ Undo This" button, not just
     the top one. Verified the core diff/conflict logic with a standalone
     unit test against synthetic blob-sha maps covering: unrelated
     commits touching different files (only the target commit's own file
     reverted, no false conflicts), a real conflict (same path touched
     again later — correctly skipped, not clobbered), added-file revert
     (deletes it), removed-file revert (restores it), the original
     "undo the actual last commit" case (still works), and a multi-file
     single commit (all its paths revert together) — all pass. Could not
     test the real GitHub API calls end-to-end for the same reason as #2
     (private repo, no token here), so this is logic-verified but not
     live-verified.

- **RESOLVED — Raghavendra Vijaya kavya data, all 10 sargas now published
  and registered.** Sequel to the entry below (which found the problem):
  the project lead confirmed "relabel and register 9 sargas, leave
  sarga_1 pending," then supplied the real sarga_1 content (42 verses,
  self-consistent `metadata.stotraCode: "sarga_1"`) directly, so all 10
  could go in at once instead of leaving a gap. Fixed as: moved
  `dge/data/kavya/"Raghavendra Vijaya"/sarga_N` → lowercase
  `dge/data/kavya/raghavendra_vijaya/sarga_(N+1)` for N=1..8 (each
  file's own embedded metadata already correctly said which sarga it
  actually was — the folder was just wrong), kept only ONE copy of the
  byte-identical sarga_9/sarga_10 duplicate under `sarga_10`, added the
  project lead's real sarga_1 as a new file, deleted the old
  space-and-capitals folder entirely (`git rm -r`, so git recorded the
  moves as renames), and added `library.json` entries for all 10 sargas.
  Verified in a real browser: all 10 sargas load with matching
  title/verse-count/rendered-card-count, and re-ran the new admin
  validator (see below) against the final corrected set — zero warnings,
  confirming the fix actually resolved every issue the validator itself
  had flagged on the original upload. 578 total shlokas across the
  complete work, no duplicates remaining (checked by hashing every
  sarga's shloka content pairwise).

- **Added real content-sanity checks to every admin write path**
  (`dge/js/admin-editor.js` → v1.18), directly prompted by the
  Raghavendra Vijaya discovery above — project lead asked "can we have
  checks when something is added/changed in data directly from admin
  page?" New `dgeAdminValidateGranthaFileEntries(fileEntries)` scans any
  `.../data.json` files in a pending upload/save and warns on exactly
  the failure modes just found for real: (a) a file's own
  `metadata.stotraCode` not matching the folder it's being placed in,
  (b) `metadata.totalShlokas` not matching the actual shloka count, (c)
  byte-identical shloka content appearing under two different paths in
  the same batch (duplicate/misplaced file), (d) a folder name with a
  space or uppercase letter (breaks from the site's
  lowercase_with_underscores convention), (e) grantha-shaped data with
  no matching entry in `data/library.json` yet — pushed but unreachable.
  Wired into all four write paths that exist: the zip uploader (shown as
  a non-blocking warning banner in its existing preview-before-confirm
  panel — that flow already had a checkpoint, so warnings just render
  there rather than adding a second confirmation), and the single-file
  upload, folder upload, and file-editor save paths (none of which had
  any preview step before, so a `confirm()` with the warning text now
  gates those instead — still overridable, this tool has to stay usable
  for arbitrary non-grantha files too). Verified for real in a browser:
  ran the validator against the actual 10 Raghavendra Vijaya files
  fetched from disk — it reproduced all 12 real problems (9 stotraCode
  mismatches, 1 duplicate pair, 1 missing-from-library.json count, 1
  naming-convention flag) with zero false positives against a known-good
  already-published file (sumadhva_vijaya sarga_9, clean run, zero
  warnings).

- **Content Editor (`dge/js/content-editor.js` → v1.2): edits now
  survive a page refresh, and there's a real Undo.** Project lead
  reported doing an inline edit on PNS, seeing it reflected, then
  refreshing and finding the old text back — with no success indicator
  to tell the difference between "staged" and "actually gone nowhere."
  This was working exactly as designed, not a bug: "Save" on an inline
  edit (or "Apply" in the structural editor) only ever stages the change
  in `stotraData` in memory — nothing reaches GitHub until "Preview &
  Save" is explicitly clicked (same intentional two-step design as
  Config Editor). But a plain in-memory stage has no way to survive a
  refresh, and the UI gave no indication that's what "Save" meant, so
  the loss read as a malfunction. Fixed by addressing the actual gap
  rather than just re-explaining the existing design:
  - Every staged edit (inline save or structural Apply) now also mirrors
    into `localStorage`, keyed per grantha file (`dgeContentDraft:<path>`),
    and is restored automatically on load — before the first render —
    so a refresh (or an accidental tab close) no longer discards work.
    Wired into `core.js`'s data-load path right after `initApp()` (needs
    to run after the `is-authorized` class is set, but re-renders once
    if a draft was actually found).
  - A toast now fires on every save/apply ("...saved in this browser —
    click Preview & Save to publish"), and the persistent save bar's
    wording now says plainly that edits are local-only and will survive
    a reload but aren't visible to anyone else yet — plus, when a draft
    was restored, how long ago it was last saved.
  - Added a real "↶ Undo" button — a bounded (20-deep) in-memory stack
    of full pre-edit snapshots, one per inline save or structural Apply,
    each poppable independently (not just a blanket "Discard all," which
    already existed and still does). **Found and fixed a real bug in my
    own first pass at this**: naively treating "undo stack empty" as
    "back to published" breaks the moment a draft was restored from
    localStorage, because the restored draft — not the true published
    file — is what the stack bottoms out at; undoing back to it would
    have wrongly cleared the dirty flag and deleted the still-unpublished
    draft. Fixed by capturing a separate pristine snapshot (the state as
    fetched from the server, before any draft is applied) once per page
    load, and having Undo compare against *that* — not stack emptiness —
    to decide whether dirty/draft state actually clears. Caught by a
    dedicated real-browser test that reproduced exactly this sequence
    (edit → reload → edit again → undo twice) before it shipped.
  - `dgeDiscardContentEdits()` and a successful `dgePushContentEdits()`
    both now clear the localStorage draft and reset the undo stack, so
    neither leaves a stale draft that would wrongly reappear on the next
    load.
  Verified in a real browser end-to-end: edit → refresh → edit still
  present in both the reading view and the structural editor (the
  project lead's exact reported sequence); two edits → undo twice →
  state matches the original fetched data byte-for-byte and dirty/draft
  both clear; discard → reload → edit is gone and draft is cleared.
  **Not built**, and explicitly out of scope for this pass: the "revert
  by two/five seconds" idea from the request was vague even in the
  request itself ("not sure what feature it could be") — interpreted as
  covered by the per-edit Undo stack above rather than building a
  separate time-scrubber, since that's the concrete mechanism a
  step-backward "revert" actually needs. If the project lead had
  something more specific in mind (e.g. a visual history timeline), say
  so and it can be scoped properly.

- **Published Sumadhva Vijaya sarga 15, 16 — this completes the full
  16-sarga work.** sarga_15: 141 verses (pages 179-207 of
  `SumadhvaVijayaMoola.pdf`). sarga_16: 58 verses (pages 208-219) — the
  work's final sarga. Cross-checked against the source's own printed
  running-total colophons: `807+141=948` (sarga 15) and `948+58=1006`
  (sarga 16, matching the source's closing "समाप्तश्चायं ग्रन्थः ।
  श्रीकृष्णार्पणमस्तु ।" — "thus this text is complete, offered to Sri
  Krishna"). 1006 total shlokas across all 16 sargas, consistent with
  every prior sarga's own running total in this chain (496→552→...→948→
  1006). Page 220 (the PDF's actual last page) is genuinely blank — Vision
  returned empty text and visual inspection confirmed a blank page, not
  an OCR or rendering failure.
  **How it was resumed and one new colophon-shaped issue found:** the
  prior session's 152-200 batch had reached sarga 15 verse 109 with no
  colophon (verse 109 closes cleanly on page 200, so no half-verse risk
  at the resume seam, but the first new proofread chunk was still
  anchored on page 200 anyway as cheap insurance, per the lesson from
  that batch). Pages 201-220 rendered fresh from the source PDF via
  PyMuPDF at the same effective scale as the existing page_200.png
  (zoom 3.0), then OCR'd (Vision) and proofread (Gemini) in 4-page
  chunks the same way as before. The redundant re-proofread of verses
  105-109 (from the anchor page) matched the already-published text
  almost exactly (one trivial hyphenation difference, "पञ्चगव्यं" vs
  "पञ्च-गव्यं" — same word) confirming no drift, so the previously
  published 1-109 were kept as-is and only 110+ appended. New wrinkle,
  same root cause family as the half-verse bug: Gemini mislabeled sarga
  16's trailing colophon-only text (no verse content of its own) as a
  spurious extra numbered shloka "59" instead of recognizing it as pure
  colophon — verse 58 already closes cleanly with "॥ ५८ ॥" right before
  it, and the source's own total (948+58=1006) confirms 58 is the real
  count. Caught by the same verse-count-vs-colophon-math cross-check
  used throughout this chain; fixed in the build script by detecting a
  shloka whose entire `sa` starts with "इति" and contains "सर्गः" as a
  standalone entry (not just embedded in the tail of the true last
  verse, which the existing `split_trailing_colophon` regex already
  handled) and popping it into `metadata.colophon` instead of keeping it
  as a numbered shloka. Ran the same numbering-gap + verse-close-marker
  scan used on 13-14 across both new sargas: zero unresolved splits.
  Verified both sargas load, render, and count correctly in a real
  browser (141/141 and 58/58 cards).

- **Fixed two real bugs in the v1 Content Editor (`dge/js/content-editor.js`
  → v1.1), found via a live user bug report on PNS** (project lead did an
  inline edit on shloka 1, saw it reflected in the reading view, then
  opened the Structural editor and reported "the old text is still seen,
  both are not in sync" — with a screenshot showing literal `<br>` tags
  visible as text in the row textarea).
  1. **Line-break format mismatch, not a real desync.** Different
     granthas store pada breaks differently: PNS (and apparently most
     stotras) use literal `<br>` HTML tags in `sa`, rendered correctly via
     `innerHTML` in the reading view; Sumadhva Vijaya's sarga files
     (10-14, built this session) use plain `\n` instead — confirmed by
     direct browser test that `.shloka-text`'s computed `white-space` is
     `normal`, so those `\n`s render as nothing at all (no visual line
     break, just wrapped continuous text) — a pre-existing cosmetic quirk
     of Sumadhva Vijaya's data, not a regression, and not what was
     reported, so left alone rather than mass-rewritten. The editor's
     plain `<textarea>` elements can't interpret either format as HTML,
     so raw `<br>` text was showing through literally — which read as
     "wrong"/"old" content even though the underlying data was actually
     in sync the whole time. Fixed by converting `<br>` (and bare `\n`)
     to real `\n` for editing (both inline textarea and structural modal
     rows) and back to `<br>` on save — `<br>` chosen as the canonical
     stored format since it's the only one of the two that actually
     renders as a line break, so any verse touched through the editor
     from now on (Sumadhva Vijaya included) gets working line breaks as a
     side effect, without touching verses nobody edited.
  2. **Real data-loss bug, found while fixing #1**: the structural
     editor's row builder, its Apply handler, and the final GitHub-push
     reconstruction all hand-picked only `sa` + `commentaries` when
     rebuilding each shloka object, silently dropping any other field —
     concretely, `note` (colophon-style text) and `reviewNote` (OCR
     review-flag text, present on several sarga_13/14 verses from this
     session's own review-flagged verses). Opening the structural editor
     and hitting Apply — even with zero edits — plus any push through
     "Preview & Save" would have stripped these fields from the live
     file. Fixed by shallow-copying the whole original shloka object at
     each of these three points instead of hand-picking two fields.
  Both fixes verified in a real headless-Chromium browser test against
  the actual PNS and sarga_13 data files: inline edit → structural
  editor round-trip now shows identical (edited) text with no literal
  `<br>` and correct row heights; Apply-without-editing on sarga_13
  preserves `reviewNote` byte-for-byte. Not yet pushed to GitHub by the
  project lead through the UI itself — only tested locally.

- **Published Sumadhva Vijaya sarga 13, 14 for real (continuing straight
  on from 10-12 above, pages 153-200 of the source PDF), and found a
  real, systemic OCR/Proofread pipeline bug in the process, not just a
  one-off boundary glitch.** sarga_13: 69 verses. sarga_14: 55 verses.
  Cross-checked against the source's own running-total colophon notes
  (`683+69=752`, `752+55=807`) — consistent with sarga_12's own ending
  total, same double-check method as before.
  **The real bug, worth remembering for any future OCR/Proofread run
  that resumes mid-document:** when a proofread chunk's first page
  starts mid-verse (the previous page's OCR wasn't fed into the SAME
  Gemini call), Gemini has no way to know it's continuing an
  in-progress verse, and silently starts renumbering from what it sees
  as its own "verse 1"-equivalent — except it isn't really starting a
  new verse, it's absorbing the second half of the cut-off one into a
  new mislabeled entry. The effect cascades: EVERY subsequent verse in
  that run comes out shifted by half a verse (each entry becomes [tail
  of true verse N] + [head of true verse N+1], carrying verse N's own
  number) for as long as the run continues, not just at the seam
  itself. Caught by actually comparing verse TEXT across the old
  (pre-resume) and new datasets at the resume point — comparing only
  verse COUNTS or numbering-sequence wouldn't have caught it, since the
  shifted numbering was still perfectly sequential (1, 2, 3, ...), just
  built from the wrong text. Same root issue recurred, in miniature, at
  ordinary chunk-to-chunk boundaries within the corrected run too (2 of
  12 four-page chunk boundaries happened to land mid-verse) — fixed by
  re-proofreading each affected span as one larger combined call
  spanning both original chunks rather than a narrow patch window (a
  narrow patch just relocates the same problem to the patch's own
  edges, confirmed the hard way — first attempt at a 4-page patch
  window created two NEW seam issues at its own boundaries against
  still-unpatched neighbouring data). Final systematic check: scan
  every shloka's `sa` field for one that doesn't end in a proper
  `॥ N ॥` verse-close marker (allowing for a small number of expected
  false positives from compound words that happen to contain "सर्ग" as
  a substring, e.g. निसर्गात्/संसर्ग-लोलैः, not real chapter markers) —
  confirms zero remaining unresolved splits in the final 152-200 range.
  **Stops at sarga 15, verse 109 (page 200, the last page of this
  batch) — NOT published**, no colophon reached yet within this range,
  so sarga 15's real length is still unknown; continuing needs OCR
  starting at page 201. 21 verses across sarga_13/14 carry a
  `reviewNote` (mostly the boundary-fix verses themselves, self-flagged
  by Gemini during the targeted re-proofreads) for the same
  spot-check-via-admin-panel workflow as sarga 10-12.
- **Published Sumadhva Vijaya sarga 10, 11, 12 for real (previously only
  1-9 were live).** Source: real Gemini-proofread OCR output from this
  session's earlier live API test (pages 109-152 of the source PDF,
  `SumadhvaVijayaMoola.pdf`), recovered from this session's own
  scratchpad rather than re-run. Verse counts cross-checked two ways —
  sequential 1..N numbering within each sarga, AND the source text's own
  running-total colophon annotations (496+56=552 after sarga 10,
  629+54=683 after sarga 12) landed exactly consistent with the computed
  552/629/683 totals, a real independent confirmation this is chaptered
  correctly, not just internally self-consistent.
  - **sarga_10**: 56 verses (1-56). **sarga_11**: 77 verses (1-77).
    **sarga_12**: 54 verses (1-54). All three have `metadata.colophon`
    populated (matching sarga_1/2/8's convention; sarga_9 itself lacks
    one, pre-existing gap, not touched).
  - **Stops at sarga 13, verse 4 (incomplete, page 152 cuts off
    mid-verse) — NOT published.** That's the real edge of what the
    earlier OCR/Proofread run covered; continuing past sarga 12 needs a
    fresh OCR/Proofread run starting at page 153.
  - **Flagged for the project lead's own review pass** (each carries a
    `reviewNote` field verbatim from Gemini's own proofreading, visible
    per-verse so discrepancies are easy to find): 7 in sarga_10, 9 in
    sarga_11, 2 in sarga_12 — mostly confidently-fixed OCR typos/
    duplicate-line artifacts with the fix explained inline, not
    necessarily errors, but worth a human glance per the project lead's
    own stated plan to spot-check via the Convert tool's admin panel.
  - **Two Sarvatobhadra/Chakrabandha citra-kavya (pattern-poetry) verses**
    (sarga_10 verses 48 and 54) have real explanatory Sanskrit prose
    captured in a `note` field, but their source pages (122, 123) also
    show a visual bandha/grid diagram that isn't captured in plain text
    at all — a genuine content gap for this verse type specifically, not
    fixable from text alone.
  - `library.json`'s pre-existing `sarga_10` stub (`populated: false`,
    no title) was fixed in place; `sarga_11`/`sarga_12` entries added
    following the sarga_1-9 pattern exactly (minimal diff, matched the
    file's existing indentation by hand rather than re-serializing the
    whole 692-entry array through `json.dump`, which would've produced
    a spurious ~6000-line diff from an indent-width mismatch — caught
    and reverted before committing).
  - **Search index NOT regenerated** — `build_search_index.py` is a
    known separate, larger backlog item (already noted below: stale
    relative to many other already-ingested granthas), out of scope for
    this pass; sarga_10-12 are readable on the site but not yet
    searchable, same current state as everything else awaiting that
    reindex.
  - **Found, but did NOT fix (separate, pre-existing, out of scope):**
    `tools/gen_library_status.py`'s `item_count()` only handles the
    newer `{schema, items:[...]}` shape — the legacy `{metadata,
    shlokas:{n:{...}}}` shape (which ALL of Sumadhva Vijaya uses, 1-12)
    always counts as 0 items, so the Library Manager dashboard's
    verse/item totals have been silently undercounting this entire
    grantha since sarga_1, not something newly broken by sarga_10-12.
    Confirmed via a no-op diff after running the regenerator. Real
    site-reading availability is unaffected (`library.json`'s
    `populated` flag is what `core.js` actually gates on, and that's
    set correctly) — this only affects the admin dashboard's own count
    display.

- **`tools/voice_lab/` added — real bug found and fixed before first real
  use.** Project lead's own uploaded files (`voice_transform.py` Track A —
  numpy/scipy pitch+formant shift for female→male re-timbre, no AI model;
  `clone_knn_vc.py` Track B — optional zero-shot kNN-VC voice conversion
  toward a reference voice, needs `torch.hub` model download; both meant
  eventually to feed a TTS feature). Ran Track A on a real 20s slice of
  the project lead's own chanting recording before trusting it (per
  session convention): the `--preset male` output measured RMS 0.004 vs
  the original's 0.158 (39x quieter) with 0% of samples carrying real
  signal (vs 76% in the source) — i.e. the output was silence plus one
  artificial click, not a deepened voice. Root cause: `phase_vocoder_stretch()`'s
  overlap-add window-normalization floor (`win[win<1e-6]=1e-6`) let
  under-covered edge samples explode to ~123x normal amplitude; the
  driver's peak-based normalize (`x/np.max(np.abs(x))`) then divided the
  *entire* clip down by that one freak sample. Fixed by flooring `win`
  relative to its own interior median (zeroing the handful of genuinely
  under-covered edge samples instead of amplifying them) and switching
  the final normalize from raw max to a 99.9th-percentile-based clip.
  Re-tested on the same real audio after the fix: RMS 0.099, 70% signal
  coverage, peak 0.69 — back in a sane, working range. Sent the project
  lead the actual fixed output (both `male` and `deepmale` presets) to
  judge quality by ear; **awaiting their listen-through verdict** before
  calling Track A done. Track B (`clone_knn_vc.py`) not tested at all yet —
  needs `torch.hub` access for WavLM+HiFiGAN, same network constraint
  that blocks Demucs model downloads in this sandbox; would need to run
  in the project lead's Codespace, same as Audio Admin.
  **Update:** project lead tested the fixed Track A on two real sources
  (their own recording, and a separately-uploaded female-voice
  `mangalacharana.mp3`) across `slightly`/`male`/`deepmale` presets —
  verdict: `deepmale` is closest but still "not good" (quality issue,
  not the earlier crash bug). Confirms Track A's plain DSP re-timbre has
  a real quality ceiling for this use case. Project lead now wants to
  try **Track B** (`clone_knn_vc.py`, zero-shot kNN-VC toward a real
  reference voice) using 5 short clips of their own voice as reference
  (`NS1/10/11/12/13.mp3`, ~90s combined — comfortably within kNN-VC's
  recommended 30-60s+). Track B needs `torch.hub.load("bshall/knn-vc", ...)`,
  which pulls from `github.com` — confirmed blocked in this sandbox
  (403, same proxy policy as the Demucs/HuggingFace blocks) — so this
  must run in the project lead's Codespace, same pattern as Audio Admin.
  Scaffolded `tools/voice_lab/incoming/{ref,source}/` (gitignored, mirrors
  Audio Admin's `incoming/` convention) for the project lead to upload
  their reference clips + a source recitation into, ready for them to
  `pip install torch torchaudio soundfile numpy` (torch itself likely
  already present from the Audio Admin install) and run `clone_knn_vc.py`.
  **Update:** Track B (`clone_knn_vc.py`) got a real end-to-end result
  after three genuine bugs found and fixed via live Codespace testing
  (all pushed): (1) an invisible zero-width space in browser-uploaded
  reference filenames that never matched anything typed by hand -- fixed
  by having `--ref` accept a folder and glob it internally instead of
  requiring typed filenames; (2) `get_matching_set()` throwing a
  tensor-shape RuntimeError when given multiple reference clips of
  different lengths -- worked around by ffmpeg-concatenating all `--ref`
  clips into one file before handing them to kNN-VC; (3) the real root
  cause of a `(2, 999, 1024)` malformed feature shape -- kNN-VC's
  `get_features()` doesn't downmix stereo input itself, so a stereo
  source/reference clip's 2 channels were being treated as 2 separate
  batch items; fixed by always downmixing both source and reference
  audio to mono/16kHz via ffmpeg before either ever reaches the model.
  **Verdict on the actual output** (project lead's own listening test):
  technically ran end-to-end, but kNN-VC is a speech-to-speech frame
  matcher with no pitch/F0 modeling -- applied to melodic chanting
  (Sumadhva Vijaya-style recitation), it flattened the raga/svara
  movement and introduced a rough, "unwell"-sounding quality (known
  artifact of kNN averaging). **Correctly diagnosed as the wrong tool
  for melodic content, not another bug to chase** -- kNN-VC is
  fundamentally built for spoken dialogue, not song. Project lead redirected
  based on this to three concrete next tasks (in progress):
  1. **Plain-speech TTS test (not chanting)** in the project lead's own
     voice, English + Sanskrit, since a from-scratch TTS generation has
     no original melody to lose (unlike kNN-VC's audio-to-audio
     conversion) -- should hold up much better for straight narration on
     the DGE site. Built `tools/voice_lab/tts_clone.py` (Coqui XTTS-v2,
     zero-shot, reuses the same `--ref`-folder pattern as
     `clone_knn_vc.py`). XTTS-v2 has no native Sanskrit checkpoint (no
     mainstream open TTS toolkit does) -- testing Sanskrit text through
     the `hi` (Hindi) language mode as the closest practical
     approximation, an experiment to judge by ear, not a validated
     solution. Noted CPML license (non-commercial + attribution) in the
     script docstring. Not yet run for real -- needs `pip install TTS`
     (~1.8GB model download) in the Codespace.
  2. **Zero-background separation** ("only pure human shloka rendering,
     no vina/tabla") for the Audio Admin splitting tool -- only
     `htdemucs` (the default) has been tried so far, and it leaves real,
     audible leakage (confirmed by the project lead listening to
     `voice_only/chunk_12.wav` directly and still hearing veena). Built
     `tools/audio_admin/compare_separation.py` to export the SAME
     region through `htdemucs`, `htdemucs_ft`, and `mdx_extra` side by
     side so the cleanest can be picked by ear. Not yet run.
  3. **Reliable shloka splitting on clips with a real ~1.5s gap** --
     explicitly deferred until task 2 lands, since the earlier
     mis-detected 1.5s gap (shlokas clubbed despite an audible pause)
     was actually caused by separation leakage keeping the "silent" gap
     non-silent in the voice track, not a detector/threshold problem.
     Should mostly resolve once a cleaner separation model is picked.
- **Audio Admin (`tools/audio_admin/`) real-world tuning in progress —
  three real defects found across two rounds of actual listening, one
  now understood to be a separation-quality limit rather than a
  threshold-tuning bug.** Project lead ran `autotune.py` on a real
  chanting recording (Sumadhva Vijaya sarga 9, 62 shlokas) in their own
  GitHub Codespace (no direct Claude access to that environment; guided
  the lead through Codespace UI + terminal manually throughout).
  Round 1 (full 62-shloka file): hit `62/62` exact count, but listening
  to actual clips surfaced two problems the count alone hid — full-mix
  clips carry background music throughout by original design, and
  adjacent shlokas (e.g. 5+6) got clubbed into one clip despite the
  *total* count coming out exact (root cause: `min_len` merge folding
  short segments into predecessors regardless of whether they're really
  separate, plus `solve_for_target()` only optimizing for total count,
  so an under-split and an over-split elsewhere can cancel out and still
  read as "exact"). Fixed: `engine.py`/`autotune.py` now also export a
  `voice_only/` sibling folder (same boundaries, cut from the cached
  separated-vocals track) for real full-mix-vs-isolated comparison, and
  `autotune.py` prints per-shloka durations flagging outliers (>1.6x or
  <0.5x median) as likely-clubbed/likely-oversplit so bad boundaries can
  be found from the terminal log instead of listening to every clip.
  Round 2 (trimmed ~6.5min/16-shloka sample, `Sarga-9-sample.mp3`, cut
  for faster iteration): confirmed the outlier-flagging works — it
  correctly caught a clubbed pair — but investigating that specific clip
  revealed a *second*, different cause: the project lead reported an
  audible, clear ~1.5s pause between the two clubbed shlokas (so it's
  not a too-short-to-detect pause), yet the tool still merged them.
  Fixed `solve_for_target()`'s previously-hardcoded 0.30s silence-
  detection floor into a `--min-sil` flag on the theory it might be a
  too-short pause elsewhere in the file, but the project lead then
  directly listened to that specific clip's `voice_only/` version and
  confirmed veena is *still clearly audible* there and the gap is "barely
  quieter but not silent" — meaning Demucs' separation itself is leaking
  real background energy into the "vocals" stem at that point, not a
  threshold-tuning problem at all. No noise-threshold sweep can find a
  gap that never actually goes quiet in the track being searched.
  **Not yet done:** try `htdemucs_ft` (slower, typically cleaner
  separation) instead of plain `htdemucs` to see if it resolves the
  leakage; if not, accept that some tightly-chanted shloka pairs may
  need manual boundary correction rather than fully automatic detection;
  decide full-mix vs. voice-only for the *final* saved clips once heard
  side-by-side (project lead asked to see both rather than commit to one
  sight-unseen — still open); lock winning params into `config.yaml`'s
  `defaults:` once settled (`min_gap` looked like it wanted to land near
  0.5s on one file, well below the current 1.5s default, not yet
  confirmed generalizable across recordings).
- **VedaVaNi Rigveda text/audio pairing not implemented.** Per-Sukta
  audio is fully downloaded (Kāñchī 1028/1028, Śṛṅgerī ~354/1028 — see
  below), but `rig_veda_multiscript.json`'s "sukta" field is actually a
  flat per-adhyaya *rik* list, not sukta-grouped — mapping rik ranges to
  individual suktas needs the Anukramani verse-count field
  (`Anukramani/Mandala_N.txt`) as a cross-reference, not yet built or
  verified. Currently shipping audio-only rather than risk a wrong
  pairing (see `tools/vedavani/extract_audio.py` module docstring).
- **VedaVaNi Rigveda is per-Sukta, not per-Rik.** The original ask was
  "one audio file per rik" — no per-word/per-rik timestamp data exists
  anywhere in the app (the `word_timestamps` Room table exists in schema
  but nothing in the decompiled playback path reads or writes it).
  Either find real per-rik boundary data somewhere else, or accept
  per-Sukta as the final granularity and say so explicitly.
- **VedaVaNi Śṛṅgerī pāṭha only has Maṇḍalas 1–4.** Confirmed via real
  HTTP 404s (not a bug in the URL scheme — the same construction
  succeeds for all 1028 Kāñchī suktas and for Śṛṅgerī 1–4). Possible
  there's a second, undiscovered URL pattern for Śṛṅgerī 5–10; not
  ruled out, just not found.
- **VedaVaNi Yajurveda not yet run at full scale.** Only small test
  scopes done so far: Samhita Kanda 1 (dry-run only), Aranyaka full (8/8
  tracks, real run). Samhita/Brahmanam haven't been run for real across
  all kandas/ashtakas.
- **Convert tool schema-picker — only partially addressed.** Shipped: a
  searchable target-grantha picker (replacing the flat 465-entry
  dropdown), AND (v0.30.3) auto-populated title/author when the picked
  target is a sibling of an already-populated multi-part work — see
  entry below. NOT shipped, still open from the original ask: a "preview
  the schema skeleton" view and a "create a new schema type" flow —
  the picker only searches existing catalog *paths*, it doesn't show or
  let you define the underlying JSON schema shape.
- ~~**Convert tool — Vision multi-page batching investigated, not built.**~~
  Superseded — the project lead asked again directly ("is it possible to
  get more than one page processed by OCR... will we save time?") and it
  WAS built: see the "batched Vision OCR calls" entry above (`ocrImagesBatch()`
  in `vision.js`, v0.27.0). The real win turned out to be fewer HTTP
  round-trips over a large book, not a per-image cost change — this
  earlier note's cost/benefit read was incomplete, not wrong about cost
  itself.
- `cowork/sarvamoola-and-search` is merged; `build_search_index.py`
  still needs re-running/extending to cover everything ingested since
  (Rāmāyaṇa/Mahābhārata/Bhāgavata/smṛti/kāvya/Ashtadhyayi/Mahabharata
  Kannada/Yukti Mallika/Svapna-Vrindavanakhyana/Harikathamrutasara).
  Kosha stays separate (bespoke data shape) unless someone designs a
  unifying pass.
- Optional: merge `kosha_schema_ADDITION.json`/`kosha_taxonomy_ADDITION.json`
  into `data/schemas.json`/`data/taxonomy.json` if koshas should appear
  in the normal library browser, not just the floating button.
- A full-corpus indexing pass once Kosha's real dataset and Sarvamoola
  both exist.
- Coordinate with parallel Sarvamoola/search work — avoid conflicts
  (standing item, session task list #39).

- **DCS/skrutable integration, scoped and piloted, 23 Aug.** Asked to
  incorporate the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS) and the `skrutable`
  library (github.com/tylergneill/skrutable) and fill gaps against them,
  with a sync pipeline. Researched both before building anything:
  - **DCS is CC-BY 4.0** (attribution only, confirmed directly from the
    `ambuda-org/dcs` mirror's README, not assumed) — 253 texts, ~1.5 GB in
    the primary mirror (`OliverHellwig/sanskrit`), word-level
    morphologically-**disambiguated** CoNLL-U annotation of real running
    text — genuinely different value from the `vidyut`-based morphology
    tooling already in `tools/build_morphology.py`, which generates
    *possible* paradigmatic forms rather than resolving *attested* ones.
    The live DCS website (`sanskrit-linguistics.org`) was down (503 on
    every page checked) during this session — not used; the GitHub mirrors
    are the actual source of truth regardless.
  - **skrutable is CC BY-SA 4.0** (share-alike) — flagged the same way
    every copyleft source has been in this project. It directly targets
    two gaps already logged as open: sandhi/compound splitting
    (`dge/VEDAWEB_IMPORT_STATUS.md` calls this "a computational-linguistics
    problem, not a sourcing problem," no candidate chosen) and Vedic-metre
    identification (explicitly abandoned in
    `dge/veda_toolkit/superseded/05_chandas_autodetect_FAILED.py` for poor
    accuracy). **Project lead's decision: use as an unmodified pip
    dependency only** (`pip install skrutable`), not vendored/adapted code
    — same relationship the repo already has with `vidyut`. One dead end
    worth recording: DCS ships `dcs/data/rigveda/Arnold/arnold-vedic-metre-*.txt`,
    which sounds like it could resolve the abandoned Vedic-chandas problem
    but on inspection is E.V. Arnold's (1905) lexical dating criteria for
    old vs. late Rigvedic strata — not per-verse metre data at all. Checked
    before being written down, not assumed from the filename.
  - **Project lead's decision on scale: pilot first**, not a full 253-text
    import. Built at `tools/dcs/`: 139 verses of Sūryasiddhānta (2 of its
    chapters, all DCS carries of this text) imported into the
    previously-empty `vedanga/jyotisha` taxonomy leaf
    (`dge/data/vedanga/jyotisha/data.json`, `library.json`'s `populated`
    flipped `true`), converted from DCS's CoNLL-U via skrutable's IAST→
    Devanagari transliterator (the approved pip-dependency use). Chosen
    over Āyurveda/Tantra texts specifically because `jyotisha` already had
    a settled taxonomy slot, unlike Āyurveda/Kāmaśāstra placement, which
    is a separate open question above. Cross-checked against
    `tools/chandas_native/`: 14/20 of the first 20 verses scan as
    Anuṣṭubh, the expected metre for a śāstra text — a real correctness
    check on the transliteration, not just valid-JSON.
  - **Not done, deliberately:** the other 252 DCS texts, an ongoing sync
    pipeline (premature before there's a real imported corpus to sync),
    and any taxonomy placement decision for DCS's Āyurveda/Tantra/Śaiva
    Āgama texts. `tools/dcs/README.md` records what scaling this further
    actually requires, so it doesn't need re-deriving.

- **Same-day follow-up, still 23 Aug: a second DCS import, a real
  duplication near-miss caught, and a load-bearing discovery about
  skrutable's sandhi/compound splitter.** Asked to populate more DCS
  content and wire sandhi/samasa splitting into the reader as a
  click-a-word feature.
  - **Checked for duplication before importing more — and it mattered.**
    `library.json` was scanned for `populated: false` leaves under
    `purana/` (68), `darshana/` (185), and `agama/` (17), then
    cross-referenced against DCS's text list, rather than assuming every
    DCS text is new content. This caught a real near-miss: DCS's
    Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa would have collided with the genuine mūla
    text already `populated: true` in `itihasa/` — importing them would
    have created duplicate/conflicting granthas, not new coverage. Not
    done, for that reason.
  - **Second import done: `Śivasūtra`**, all 74 sutras across its 3
    unmeṣas (DCS's complete text, not an excerpt), into the previously-
    empty `agama/pancharatra/shaiva_agama/data.json` — same safe pattern
    as the Sūryasiddhānta pilot, found via the duplication check above.
    `tools/dcs/dcs_common.py` factors out the CoNLL-U parsing so this and
    the next import share code; verified byte-identical re-generation of
    the jyotisha output after the refactor. Content spot-checked
    correct, not just valid JSON: sutra 1.1 is चैतन्यमात्मा ("caitanyam
    ātmā"), the actual, well-known opening line of the text.
  - **A rough keyword pass over DCS's 253 texts against `library.json`**
    (not a real classification — see `tools/dcs/README.md` for the
    caveat) found more candidate empty-leaf matches worth checking
    properly: `Matsyapurāṇa` (but DCS carries the **full 174-chapter
    text** — a much bigger job than either import so far), several
    Purāṇa sub-leaves, and a `Vaiśeṣikasūtra`/`Yogasūtra`/`Sāṃkhyakārikā`
    cluster under `darshana/`. 184/253 stayed unclassified by the rough
    pass. None of these are imported yet.
  - **The sandhi/samasa splitting request hit a genuine blocker, surfaced
    rather than built around.** Tested `skrutable.splitting.Splitter`
    directly against the specific gap named — visarga sandhi and
    consonant (hal) sandhi, both said to be missing from the existing
    Vidyut-based tooling — and it handles both correctly: `rāmo
    gacchati` → `rāmaḥ gacchati` (visarga), `taddhi` → `tat hi` and
    `sajjanaḥ` → `sat-janaḥ` (hal sandhi), all verified by direct testing,
    not assumed from the README. But reading `splitting.py` turned up
    something that changes what's safe to build on this: **the splitter
    is not local computation** — both its models are thin wrappers over
    remote third-party HTTP APIs (`dharmamitra.org`'s tagging endpoint by
    default, or an older `2018emnlp-sanskrit-splitter-server.duckdns.org`
    research demo). Every call in the tests above was a live network
    request to `dharmamitra.org`. This is unlike everything else used
    from skrutable so far (`transliteration.py`, `meter_identification.py`
    — both confirmed by grep to be pure local code, no network calls) and
    unlike `vidyut`, which runs fully offline. Two real consequences,
    neither resolved here: (1) a "click any word, get its sandhi split"
    feature would mean every DG site visitor's clicked word gets sent to
    `dharmamitra.org` in real time — a live third-party dependency and a
    data-sharing fact about the site that's worth deciding on knowingly,
    not wiring in silently; (2) precomputing splits across the corpus
    (the kāvya branch alone has ~95,000 entries) means tens or hundreds of
    thousands of requests against someone else's server, with no
    confirmed terms of service for bulk automated use — the kind of load
    a considerate caller batches and paces, not fires all at once. Neither
    the live-click feature nor a bulk precompute pass was built pending a
    decision on this trade-off.

- **Same-day follow-up: the live click-to-split feature, built.** Project
  lead chose live click-to-split over precompute or holding off. Built at
  `dge/js/sandhi.js`, wired to a new "🔗 Sandhi" button alongside the
  existing 🔤 Shabda / 📚 Dhātu / 🔍 Where else word-tools in
  `#actionTooltip` (`dge/index.html`) — same "real structured data, not an
  LLM guess" philosophy as those three. Selected text is transliterated to
  IAST client-side (Devanagari input isn't reliably recognized by the
  API — confirmed by testing, see below), sent to `dharmamitra.org`'s
  `/api-tagging/tagging-parsed/` endpoint, and the `unsandhied` field per
  word — literally the answer to "give me the sandhi split" — is shown
  transliterated back to the reader's active script, alongside lemma and
  grammatical tag. Session-only client-side cache so re-opening the same
  selection doesn't re-fetch. `dge/index.html`'s version meta and
  `core.js`'s `DGE_EXPECTED_HTML_VERSION` both bumped to 4.64.0 (structural
  HTML change), per that file's own stated convention.
  - **What was actually verified, stated precisely rather than claimed
    wholesale:** (1) the exact request shape sandhi.js constructs was
    tested directly against the live API via `curl` and confirmed correct
    on the specific gap named — `rāmo gacchati` → `rāmaḥ gacchati`
    (visarga), `taddhi` → `tat hi` and `sajjanaḥ` → `sat-janaḥ` (hal/
    consonant sandhi) — plus discovered a real precondition: a single word
    with no sentence context resolves less reliably than a full clause
    (`rāmo` alone stayed `rāmo`, unresolved), so the feature sends whatever
    span the user actually selected rather than trying to isolate a single
    word. (2) The full UI flow was driven end-to-end in a real headless
    browser (Playwright, since no project-specific run skill exists yet —
    worth generating one via `/run-skill-generator` next time this app
    needs driving): text selection, the tooltip, the modal opening,
    transliteration, and the error-handling path all confirmed working via
    screenshots. (3) **The live network call itself could not be completed
    inside this session's sandbox** — Chromium launched via Playwright
    couldn't reach the public internet at all (`fetch()` to `example.com`
    failed identically to `dharmamitra.org`, isolating this as the
    sandboxed browser subprocess's own network access, not anything
    dharmamitra-specific or a bug in this code) — so the graceful-failure
    path is what got observed live, not a live success. Given (1) and (2)
    both check out and the failure mode in (3) is demonstrably
    environment-specific, this is shipped with high confidence, not
    unverified — but the one thing not literally watched happen in a
    browser is a live person's browser completing this exact fetch to
    dharmamitra.org, so it's worth a real check after deploy.

  - **New source flagged, licence checked, not used: ByT5-Sanskrit, the
    model actually behind dharmamitra.org.** Asked whether "the logic"
    could be replicated locally. It isn't a rule engine to reimplement —
    it's a 0.6B-parameter ByT5 transformer (`chronbmm/sanskrit5-multitask`
    on HuggingFace, base model `buddhist-nlp/byt5-sanskrit`), fine-tuned
    on DCS data by Sebastian Nehrdich and Oliver Hellwig (DCS's own
    author) with Kurt Keutzer, published EMNLP 2024 Findings
    (arXiv:2409.13920, "One Model is All You Need: ByT5-Sanskrit").
    Inference code is public at `github.com/dharmamitra/byt5-sanskrit-
    analyzers` (the `applications/` folder runs the model locally, given
    the weights) — genuinely a better path than a hand-written rule-based
    splitter would be, since sandhi/compound segmentation is ambiguous
    enough that this became a trained-model research problem in the first
    place, not something rules alone solve well.
    **Licence checked directly, not assumed: unspecified everywhere it
    could be stated.** The GitHub repo has no LICENSE file (confirmed by
    listing every file in a full clone, not just checking common
    filenames) and no licence classifier in any config. The HuggingFace
    model card for `chronbmm/sanskrit5-multitask` states "[More
    Information Needed]" for licence. The `buddhist-nlp/byt5-sanskrit`
    base model card has no licence field at all. Only the *paper itself*
    carries an explicit licence (CC BY 4.0, on arXiv) — that covers the
    publication text, not the code or model weights, which is a normal
    and important distinction (arXiv's CC BY default applies to the
    submission, not automatically to linked artifacts). Under this
    project's own "no explicit licence = not cleared" rule
    (`dge/kosha_toolkit/LICENSING.md`), this is **Unclear**, the same
    category as several already-loaded kosha sources — not used here,
    logged for a future case-by-case call. If ever pursued, it's also a
    real infrastructure step up from anything in this project so far: a
    Python ML inference environment (transformers/torch), not another
    static-JSON precompute script — worth treating as its own scoped
    decision, not a quick add-on.

    **23 Aug: free/cheap hosting options researched for testing this
    model, in case the licence question resolves.** A 0.6B ByT5 runs
    fine on CPU (~1-4 GB RAM) — no GPU needed at this scale, which
    removes most of the friction below. **Recommended first try: HF
    Spaces, free CPU-basic tier** (2 vCPU/16 GB RAM, genuinely free,
    sleeps after 48h idle with a ~30-60s wake, ships a Gradio UI + API
    for free). **Second choice: Modal.com** ($30/month free credits,
    pay-per-second, no idle charges — stretches far for sporadic testing,
    more control than Spaces' Gradio wrapper). Google Cloud Cloud Run's
    Always Free tier (scale-to-zero, ~2M requests/month) is also
    workable CPU-only, but has no free GPU tier (not needed here) and a
    cold-start hit on scale-from-zero; Vertex AI's trial credits exist
    but bill hourly even idle, easy to burn by accident, and the current
    credit amount/duration wasn't confirmed. Colab/Kaggle are
    interactive notebooks, not stable hosting endpoints, for this
    purpose. fly.io's free tier is gone for new accounts. Render's free
    512MB instance is RAM-tight for this model size, unconfirmed either
    way. If this ever goes from testing to always-on, a small paid Cloud
    Run instance (~$5-15/mo) is the natural next step, not GPU
    infrastructure. Still blocked on the licence question above before
    any of this actually gets used.

- **Same-day follow-up: batch-imported everything DCS has that exactly
  matches an existing empty taxonomy leaf, plus a real parser bug found
  and fixed mid-run.** Asked to "load all the pending stuff from DCS
  which our taxonomy folders are missing." Ran a precise match (not the
  23 Aug rough keyword pass): normalize both DCS's 253 texts.csv names
  and every `library.json` leaf's title/path segment (strip diacritics,
  lowercase, alnum-only) and require an exact match — deliberately no
  fuzzy matching, so nothing lands in the wrong place silently. Found 13:

  | DCS text | items | taxonomy leaf |
  |---|---|---|
  | Agnipurāṇa | 610 | `purana/agni_purana/` |
  | Matsyapurāṇa | 8,341 | `purana/matsya_purana/` (all 175 chapters DCS has) |
  | Kālikāpurāṇa | 288 | `purana/upapuranas/kalika_purana/` |
  | Narasiṃhapurāṇa | 35 | `purana/upapuranas/narasimha_purana/` |
  | Varāhapurāṇa | 39 | `purana/varaha_purana/` |
  | Gautamadharmasūtra | 891 | `vedanga/kalpa/independent_dharmasutras/gautama_dharmasutra/` |
  | Nirukta | 610 | `vedanga/nirukta/` |
  | Gopathabrāhmaṇa | 4,241 | `vedas/atharvaveda/shaunaka_shakha/brahmana/gopatha_brahmana/` |
  | Aitareya-Āraṇyaka | 862 | `vedas/rigveda/shakala_shakha/aranyakas/aitareya_aranyaka/` |
  | Aitareyabrāhmaṇa | 3,733 | `vedas/rigveda/shakala_shakha/brahmanas/aitareya_brahmana/` |
  | Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa | 7,325 | `vedas/samaveda/jaiminiya_shakha/brahmanas/jaiminiya_brahmana/` |
  | Sāmavidhānabrāhmaṇa | 330 | `vedas/samaveda/kauthuma_shakha/brahmanas/samavidhana_brahmana/` |
  | Maitrāyaṇīsaṃhitā | 7,954 | `vedas/yajurveda/krishna_yajurveda/maitrayani_shakha/samhita/maitrayani_samhita/` |

  **~35,300 new items, `library.json`'s `populated` flag flipped `true`
  on all 13**, `tools/validate_data.py` clean (0 errors, same 3
  pre-existing warnings). Content spot-checked, not just JSON-validated:
  Nirukta 1.1.1 is Yāska's own opening line ("समाम्नायः समाम्नातः"),
  Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 1.1.1.1 is the well-known Yajurveda opening ("इषे
  त्वा सुभूताय") — both independently recognizable as correct, not just
  well-formed.

  **A real parser bug surfaced mid-run, caught by checking output
  plausibility rather than trusting the item count.** `dcs_common.py`
  only handled DCS's verse-pada convention (`sent_counter`/
  `sent_subcounter` alternating 1/2). Running it on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa —
  285 real `.conllu` files — produced 8 items. Eight, from 285 files: an
  obviously-wrong number, not accepted at face value. Inspecting the raw
  files directly (not guessing from the item count) found two more
  conventions DCS actually uses: prose files leave `sent_subcounter`
  blank on *every* sentence rather than omitting the field, since prose
  doesn't pair into padas — the fix must not skip these units, but also
  must not confuse them with the separate case (found earlier, in
  Matsyapurāṇa) of an isolated genuinely-blank subcounter amid otherwise-
  numbered verse text. And roughly 20% of Aitareya/Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa's
  files have no counter fields at all, only a bare `# sent_id =
  NNNNNN_M`. For that fallback, consecutive sentences (e.g. `650034_1`,
  `650034_2`) turned out to be independently complete sentences in the
  files actually read, not two halves of one verse -- so the fix
  deliberately gives each its own item via a per-file running index
  rather than grouping by sent_id's own numbering, which would have
  risked merging unrelated sentences into one. Fixed, then the two
  already-shipped imports (Sūryasiddhānta, Śivasūtra) were re-run and
  diffed byte-for-byte against their pre-fix output to confirm zero
  regression before trusting the fix on new data. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa then
  produced 3,733 items; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa went from 9 to 7,325.
  Full account, including which of the three conventions applies to which
  text, is in `dcs_common.py`'s own docstrings (`_parse_int`,
  `parse_conllu_file`) — read those before extending this further.

  **Not done, deliberately:** vendor size is now ~54 MB (`.conllu`
  sources) plus a few MB of generated JSON per large text, committed
  directly to `main` rather than a CDN branch, per the project lead's
  already-recorded decision to lift the 1 GB caution. Remaining DCS texts
  (238 of 253) either didn't match an existing leaf under this
  conservative exact-match rule (a fuzzier, human-checked pass would
  likely find more) or have no taxonomy placement decided yet
  (Āyurveda/Tantra, same open question as before) — `tools/dcs/README.md`
  has the specifics. No sync pipeline built yet either, though with 15
  texts / ~35,700 items now in, that's a more defensible next step than
  it was at 2 texts.

- **Same-day follow-up: a taxonomy-placement proposal for the remaining
  238, published as an artifact, then Tier A of it executed.** Asked
  "where should the remaining 238 go against our fixed taxonomy." Built a
  tiered proposal (published to the user as an artifact) after real
  research, not by guessing from titles: normalized-exact-match against
  every `populated: false` leaf found ~95 safe matches (Tier A), five
  genuine taxonomy gaps affecting ~93 texts (Tier B — Āyurveda+Rasaśāstra
  +nighaṇṭu, Buddhist literature, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Tantra/Śaiva naming),
  ~11 duplication risks caught by checking `populated` status directly
  rather than assumed (Tier C — Bhāgavatapurāṇa, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata,
  Ṛgveda, Atharvaveda-Śaunaka, Taittirīyasaṃhitā, plus three kāvya-dist
  titles already marked "complete" there: Meghadūta, Kumārasambhava,
  Kirātārjunīya), ~30 that belong on the separate kāvya-dist pipeline
  (Tier D), and ~14 genuinely unclear without opening the text (Tier E).
  User picked Tier A to execute now.

  **Tier A turned out deeper than the proposal's own top-level
  taxonomy.json read suggested** — checking `library.json` directly (not
  just the 2-level `taxonomy.json` dump) found the fine-grained śākhā
  structure (`vedanga/kalpa/<veda>/<school>/{shrautasutra,grihyasutra,
  dharmasutra}`) already exists as ~41 empty leaves, precise enough to
  match nearly every Vedic ancillary text in Tier A by name. Two more
  corrections the proposal itself had gotten slightly wrong, caught by
  checking rather than trusting the earlier pass: Vājasaneyisaṃhitā
  (Mādhyandina) is *not* a safe Tier A match after all — the Mādhyandina
  leaf is already 100% populated; only the separate Kāṇva-recension leaf
  is empty, and DCS's text is explicitly Mādhyandina, so importing it
  there would misfile a different recension into the wrong śākhā's slot.
  Left out for that reason. Kāṭhakasaṃhitā, absent from the original
  scan, does have a precise empty leaf (`krishna_yajurveda/katha_shakha/
  samhita/katha_samhita`) and was added.

  **A new import shape was needed and built:** four texts — Viṣṇu/Liṅga/
  Kūrma Purāṇa and Paippalāda Atharvaveda — split across *several*
  existing empty leaves by book/kāṇḍa number rather than landing in one.
  Checked DCS's actual chapter-numbering before assuming a mapping:
  Viṣṇu Purāṇa's DCS chapters carry book numbers 1-6, matching its
  `amsha_01..06` leaves exactly; Liṅga and Kūrma Purāṇa carry exactly
  1-2, matching `purva_bhaga`/`uttara_bhaga`; Paippalāda's DCS excerpt
  only covers kāṇḍas 1, 4, 5, 10, 12, 19 of 20 (a partial source, not a
  parsing gap — the other 14 kāṇḍas' leaves stay empty because DCS
  itself doesn't have them). `dcs_common.py` gained `build_split_import()`
  for this, sharing its underlying parsing with the existing
  `build_generic_import()` (refactored into `collect_padas()` +
  `_build_items()` + `_write_data_json()`, re-verified byte-identical on
  both already-shipped imports after the refactor before trusting it on
  new data). Garuḍapurāṇa turned out *not* to need splitting — DCS only
  has its Pūrva Khaṇḍa (book 1), so it landed as a single import.

  **32 single-leaf imports + 4 split imports, ~65,000 items total.**
  Content spot-checked, not just JSON-validated: Nyāyasūtra 1.1.1 is its
  exact famous opening line ("pramāṇa-prameya-saṃśaya-prayojana-...");
  Vaiśeṣikasūtra 1.1.1 is its exact famous opening ("athāto dharmaṃ
  vyākhyāsyāmaḥ"); Paippalāda 1.1.1 matches the recognizable Vedic
  water-hymn pattern shared with the Śaunaka Saṃhitā's own well-known
  opening. `library.json`'s `populated` flipped `true` on all 48 touched
  leaves; `tools/validate_data.py` clean (0 errors, same 3 pre-existing
  warnings). Full per-text mapping in `tools/dcs/build_batch2.py`.

  **Not done:** Skandapurāṇa and Śivapurāṇa were in the proposal's Tier A
  but turned out not to be simple chapter-mappings on inspection — Skanda's
  DCS chapters are plain sequential numbers with no khaṇḍa name, and
  Śivapurāṇa's are named by saṃhitā but "Dharmasaṃhitā" doesn't match any
  of the 7 existing empty saṃhitā leaves (the traditional 7 don't include
  a Dharma Saṃhitā by that name) — both need an actual scholar's
  concordance, not a guessed mapping, so left for later. Tier B (the five
  taxonomy gaps) and Tier D (kāvya-dist routing) are unstarted — the
  proposal artifact has the detail for whoever picks those up next.

- **Same-day: a correction to the proposal itself, caught before starting
  Tier B.** The proposal's Tier B had listed "Upaniṣad mūla texts" as a
  taxonomy gap — wrong. Checking `library.json` (not just recalling the
  earlier `taxonomy.json` read) found precise empty leaves already exist
  under each Upaniṣad's own Veda/śākhā: Chāndogya (Sāmaveda/Kauthuma),
  Kaṭha (Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda/Kāṭhaka), Taittirīya (Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda/
  Taittirīya), Aitareya (Ṛgveda/Śākala), Muṇḍaka (Atharvaveda/Śaunaka),
  plus Kena, Maitrāyaṇīya, and Īśā (not in the remaining-238 list).
  Imported the 5 with a clean DCS match (`tools/dcs/
  build_batch3_upanishads.py`, 1,707 items); content spot-checked, not
  just validated — Kaṭhopaniṣad 1.1 is its exact opening line (Naciketas
  frame story). Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad deliberately excluded: the taxonomy
  has separate Kāṇva and Mādhyandina recension leaves, but DCS's own
  chapter headers ("BĀU") don't say which recension its text is — guessed
  differently, this could misattribute a real textual variant, so left
  for later rather than picked arbitrarily. Śvetāśvatara and Kauṣītaki
  Upaniṣad, and the minor Upaniṣads (Garbha, Nādabindu, Brahmabindu,
  Amṛtabindu, Śira), still have no taxonomy leaf — the genuine residual
  gap, smaller than the proposal originally claimed.

- **23 Aug (next session): started Tier B, and hit an open question
  before drafting the other four gap clusters.** Instructed to defer
  Tier D (kāvya-dist routing) and go ahead with Tier B (the genuine
  taxonomy gaps: Āyurveda+Rasaśāstra+Nighaṇṭu, Buddhist literature,
  Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Tantra/Śaiva-Śākta naming, Nīti/Nāṭya/Kāma/Alaṃkāra-śāstra).
  Before drafting new top-level structure from scratch, checked what the
  codebase itself already assumes: `dge/js/library.js`'s `DGE_PATH_LABELS`
  dict carries a comment naming "the recommended DGE taxonomy
  (`DGE_Shastra_Taxonomy.md`)" as the thing it's tracking — and that file
  **does not exist anywhere in this repo** (confirmed by search, not
  assumed absent). The dict already has Devanagari labels for `sankhya`
  and `yoga` under `darshana`, but nothing for `ayurveda`, Buddhist
  literature, or Tantra. That's a real, load-bearing distinction: Sāṃkhya
  and Yoga are pre-planned by whatever authored that reference document,
  the other four Tier B clusters are not confirmed against it at all —
  building them now would mean inventing structure that might conflict
  with a document this session cannot see. **Still open: does the project
  lead have `DGE_Shastra_Taxonomy.md`, or is inventing the remaining four
  clusters' structure the right call regardless?**

  Proceeded only with the confirmed-safe part: added `darshana.sankhya`
  (`sutra_and_karika`: `samkhya_karika` with `mula`/`tika_gaudapada`/
  `tika_mathara`/`tika_tattva_kaumudi`/`tika_yuktidipika`, and
  `samkhya_sutra` with `mula`/`bhashya_vijnanabhikshu`/`vritti_aniruddha`)
  and `darshana.yoga` (`sutra_and_bhashya.yoga_sutra` with `mula` plus 4
  commentary leaves) to `taxonomy.json`, mirroring the sibling
  `mula`+`tika_*` pattern already used by `nyaya_sutra`/`vaisheshika_sutra`.
  Note the folder is spelled `sankhya`, matching `DGE_PATH_LABELS`'s key
  exactly — caught by grepping `library.js` before writing `library.json`,
  not assumed from the Sanskrit transliteration convention used
  elsewhere in this session's own file/slug names (which would have
  produced the wrong, unmatched `samkhya`).

  Of the 13 leaves drafted, checked against the DCS mirror by listing
  (not assumed): **Sāṃkhyakārikā and Sāṃkhyasūtra's own mūla texts are
  not in DCS at all** — only Sāṃkhyatattvakaumudī (a commentary) is.
  Yogasūtra mūla and its Vyāsabhāṣya both are. Imported via
  `tools/dcs/build_batch4_samkhya_yoga.py`: 20 + 186 + 785 = 991 items
  across those 3 leaves; the other 10 stay `populated: false` stubs.
  Content spot-checked against independently known text: Yogasūtra 1.1 is
  the universally known "अथ योगानुशासनम्", its final sūtra is the equally
  known "...कैवल्यं स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा वा चितिशक्तिः", and Yogasūtrabhāṣya's
  first unit is Vyāsa's own gloss on the word *atha*.

  **A real bug found and fixed while running this, not after** (same
  discipline as the 24 Aug prose-brāhmaṇa parser fix): Sāṃkhyatattvakaumudī's
  `## chapter:` line is a single already-dotted field (`STKau zu SāṃKār,
  1.2`) rather than several comma-separated bare integers — the only DCS
  text seen so far with this 4th convention. The original
  `_parse_chapter_path` silently produced `chapter_path = None` for every
  sentence in it (0 items from 14 files — caught as implausible, the same
  standard applied to every count in this project, not accepted as "just
  a short text"). Fixed in `tools/dcs/dcs_common.py` to accept a
  comma-field that is itself dot-separated digits; re-verified
  byte-identical against every already-shipped import (pilot, batches
  1–3) before trusting it on new data. Sāṃkhyatattvakaumudī went 0 → 20
  items, and — because the same convention turned out to affect
  Yogasūtrabhāṣya too — that text's first (silently wrong) count of 106
  corrected to 785.

  DCS running total: **59 texts, 71 taxonomy leaves, 106,140 items.**
  Tier B's other four clusters (Āyurveda+Rasaśāstra+Nighaṇṭu, Buddhist
  literature, Tantra/Śaiva-Śākta naming, Nīti/Nāṭya/Kāma/Alaṃkāra-śāstra)
  remain unstarted, blocked on the `DGE_Shastra_Taxonomy.md` question
  above. Tier D (kāvya-dist routing) remains deliberately deferred per
  this session's instruction.

- **23 Aug (same session): the `DGE_Shastra_Taxonomy.md` question above
  answered directly by the project lead, not by finding the document.**
  Instruction, in the lead's own terms rather than this session's
  invention: a `shastra` folder holds *all* possible śāstras (Nāṭya,
  Kāma, Nīti, Saṅgīta, Vāstu, "etc."); Āyurveda and similarly-scoped
  practical sciences fall under **Upavedas**, a separate top-level
  branch, not under `shastra`; Buddhist literature "can be treated as
  Śāstra, I guess" — a deliberately loose steer, taken as "fold it under
  `shastra.bauddha_sahitya` unless something specific needs asking."
  Tier D stays last, confirmed again.

  Added two new top-level `taxonomy.json` branches accordingly:
  `upaveda` (`ayurveda` — with `samhita`/`nighantu`/`rasashastra`
  sub-branches — and `dhanurveda`; `gandharvaveda`/`sthapatyaveda` added
  as empty stubs, no DCS match found for either) and `shastra`
  (`natya_shastra`, `kama_shastra`, `niti_shastra`, and
  `bauddha_sahitya` with `sutra`/`shastra`/`pramana`/`avadana`
  sub-branches for the doctrinal/scholastic texts only — Buddhacarita
  and Saundarānanda are kāvya biographies, not śāstra, and were left for
  Tier D instead of placed here). `dge/js/library.js`'s
  `DGE_PATH_LABELS` gained Devanagari labels for every new segment name.
  57 leaves added via `tools/dcs/build_batch5_upaveda_shastra.py`, all
  57 populated from DCS — the highest single-batch hit rate so far.

  **Every placement was checked against the text's own DCS `##
  chapter:` line, not trusted from its DCS-given name** — this caught a
  real near-miss: "Ratnaṭīkā" reads like a rasashastra commentary by
  name, but its chapter line is `zu GaṇaKar` (a commentary on
  Gaṇakārikā, a Pāśupata Śaiva text) — excluded entirely, out of scope
  for this batch. "Āyurvedarasāyana" and "Ratnadīpikā" also looked
  plausible by name but lacked a clean, unambiguous genre signal in
  their own headers — excluded rather than guessed in. All three are
  genuinely unplaced, not silently dropped.

  **A real bug found and fixed while checking Carakasaṃhitā before
  importing it, not after** (same discipline as every prior batch's
  parser fixes): a non-numeric SECTION NAME can sit between numeric
  chapter-path fields — `Ca, Sū., 1` vs `Ca, Cik., 1`, two different
  sections of the same saṃhitā (Carakasaṃhitā alone has 8). The parser
  had been dropping non-numeric fields (correct for Maitrāyaṇī
  Saṃhitā/Aitareya Brāhmaṇa's convention) — here that would have
  silently collapsed two different sthānas' chapter 1 onto the same id,
  overwriting one with the other. Fixed in `tools/dcs/dcs_common.py` by
  keeping non-numeric fields as slugs; re-verified byte-identical
  against every already-shipped import (pilot through batch 4) before
  trusting it on new data.

  Content spot-checked, not just validated: Nāṭyaśāstra 1.1 is Bharata's
  own well-known opening invocation, Hitopadeśa's first unit is its
  famous "siddhiḥ sādhye satām astu" verse, Abhidharmakośa 1.1 is "oṃ
  namo buddhāya". ~~**One honest anomaly, not smoothed over**:
  Mūlamadhyamakakārikā's unit 1.1 has ~30 words that don't match
  Nāgārjuna prepended to a genuine, verifiable Nāgārjuna verse ("na
  svato nāpi parato..."), while every other unit checked (1.2 onward) is
  unambiguously correct — present in DCS's own source file exactly as
  shown, not a parsing artifact, left open for closer review rather than
  silently trusted or silently altered.~~ **Closer review done, source
  identified with direct evidence, corrected (25 Aug).** The prepended
  fragment — "kvacinmahāmate buddhakṣetre'nimiṣaprekṣayā dharmo deśyate
  kvacidiṅgitaiḥ kvacidbhūvikṣepeṇa kvacin netrasaṃcāreṇa kvacidāsyena
  kvacidvijṛmbhitena kvacidutkāsanaśabdena" ("in some Buddha-field the
  Dharma is taught by an unblinking gaze, in some by gestures, in some
  by movement of the brow...") — is not Nāgārjuna at all. It is the
  Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra's well-known passage on wordless teaching across
  Buddha-fields, confirmed directly rather than by name-recognition
  alone: that exact sentence appears as a clean, correctly-tokenized
  unit of its own in DCS's *own* vendored Laṅkāvatārasūtra source file
  (also imported this batch, `dge/data/shastra/bauddha_sahitya/sutra/
  lankavatara_sutra`) — a different, unrelated text in the same DCS
  Buddhist corpus. `grep -l` across all 27 of this text's `.conllu`
  files confirms no other chapter carries the contamination, so this
  is an isolated upstream splice in DCS's own chapter-1 source file
  (most likely two adjacent source files merged at a boundary during
  DCS's own preparation), not a pattern our importer needs to guard
  against generically. Corrected directly in
  `mula_madhyamaka_karika/mula/data.json`'s unit 1.1: the fragment
  removed, the genuine kārikā ("na svato nāpi parato na dvābhyāṃ
  nāpyahetutaḥ / utpannā jātu vidyante bhāvāḥ kvacana kecana") kept, and
  the full removed fragment recorded verbatim in the item's own `notes`
  field so the correction is auditable from the shipped data itself,
  not just this changelog. `validate_data.py`: 0 errors.

  DCS running total: **116 texts, 128 taxonomy leaves, 162,136 items.**
  Still open: Tantra/Śaiva-Śākta naming (deliberately untouched this
  round — the `Ratnaṭīkā` near-miss above sits right on this cluster's
  edge), and whatever the project lead meant by "etc." in the śāstra
  list beyond Nāṭya/Kāma/Nīti/Saṅgīta/Vāstu (Saṅgītaśāstra and
  Vāstuśāstra/Śilpaśāstra have no DCS match found — no candidate text
  with that name turned up in the mirror — so `gandharvaveda` and
  `sthapatyaveda` stay empty stubs rather than force-filled).

- **23 Aug (same session): asked directly to "just check" whether the
  classical darśanas (Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, Vaiśeṣika, Yoga, Sāṃkhya) had
  anything DCS carries that batches 2/4 missed — they did, including a
  real correction to batch 4's own claim, caught only by re-scanning
  DCS's full text-name list rather than repeating the per-text checks.**

  **Sāṃkhyakārikā's mūla text is in DCS.** Batch 4 said it wasn't,
  "checked by listing, not assumed" — but the actual check run was an
  ASCII `grep -i "sankhy\|samkhy"` over the mirror's directory names,
  which cannot match "Sāṃkhyakārikā": `ā` and `ṃ` are different Unicode
  codepoints from `a`/`n`, and `grep -i` folds case, not diacritics.
  Re-ran the check as `echo "Sāṃkhyakārikā" | grep -i "sankhy\|samkhy"`
  against the real name to confirm the failure mode before writing this
  down, not just asserting it. The directory was there the whole time.
  Imported (73 items); spot-checked against Īśvarakṛṣṇa's genuinely
  famous opening ("duḥkhatrayābhighātāj jijñāsā...") — exact match.

  Five more matches, all filling *existing* empty stubs rather than
  needing new taxonomy structure (two exceptions noted below):
  - **Sāṃkhyakārikābhāṣya** → the `tika_gaudapada` stub from batch 4.
    DCS's own metadata doesn't name an author for this text — the
    placement rests on "Sāṃkhyakārikābhāṣya" being the standard
    scholarly name specifically for Gauḍapāda's commentary, not on
    anything DCS itself confirms. Flagged, not asserted as fact.
  - **Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣya** → the `shabara_bhashya` stub (already in
    `taxonomy.json` before this session, from the original repo).
    Śabara's bhāṣya is *the* Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣya by convention — high
    confidence, unlike the Gauḍapāda case above. Spot-checked: its first
    unit is its own well-known opening on Mīmāṃsāsūtra 1.1.1.
  - **Tattvavaiśāradī** → the `tika_tattva_vaisharadi` stub from batch
    4, exact match confirmed via its own `zu YS, 4, 1.1` chapter line
    (commentary on Yogasūtra 4.1 — Vācaspati Miśra's Tattvavaiśāradī).
  - **Vaiśeṣikasūtravṛtti** — no commentary leaf existed at all under
    `vaisheshika_sutra` (only `mula`); added a new `vritti` leaf.
    Author unconfirmed by DCS's own metadata here too.
  - **Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha** — Mādhava Vidyāraṇya's doxography
    surveying *every* darśana, confirmed by its own chapter names being
    darśana-school names (`SDS, Rāseśvaradarśana`, etc., not numbers) —
    doesn't belong nested under any single darshana. Added as its own
    new leaf, `darshana.sarvadarshana_sangraha.mula`. Spot-checked: its
    Rāseśvaradarśana chapter content (pārada/mercury, rasārṇava) matches
    that chapter's known subject (the alchemical Rasa-Śaiva school).

  `tools/dcs/build_batch6_darshana_gaps.py`; 6/6 matched and imported,
  zero misses this round. DCS running total: **122 texts, 134 taxonomy
  leaves, 164,708 items.**

- **23 Aug (same session): structural feedback acted on, then Smriti/
  Dharmashastra (batch 7) and Tantra/Saiva-Sakta (batch 8) sweeps, plus
  several loose ends from the same request.**

  **Restructure**: `upaveda` moved from a top-level `taxonomy.json` key
  to `vedas.upaveda`, per explicit instruction ("under Veda you can have
  Upaveda... Sastra is a different parent folder just like itihasa and
  Purana"); `shastra` stayed top-level. **A real staging bug was caught
  doing this**: the first restructure commit only captured the file
  renames (`git mv`) — a follow-up multi-path `git add` that included
  one already-moved (now nonexistent) path failed entirely
  (`fatal: pathspec ... did not match any files` aborts the *whole*
  invocation, staging nothing), so `taxonomy.json`/`library.json`'s
  edits silently never got committed even though the working tree had
  them right the whole time. Caught because batch 7's own diff came out
  far larger than a 3-leaf addition should — not assumed clean. Fixed
  by re-staging everything with a single `git add -A` and verifying
  `git show HEAD:...` matched the working tree before moving on.

  **Batch 7 (Smriti/Dharmashastra)**: checked `library.json` first —
  Manusmṛti, Nāradasmṛti, Parāśarasmṛti, Viṣṇusmṛti, Yājñavalkyasmṛti
  are already `populated: true` with no `source` field (sourced from
  outside DCS, predating this session) — left untouched to avoid a
  conflicting duplicate inside an already-filled leaf. Three real
  matches: Vṛddhayamasmṛti → the empty `yama_smriti` leaf; Kātyāyanasmṛti
  → a new leaf (no existing match); Nibandhasaṃgraha — looked like a
  dharmaśāstra digest by name, but its own chapter header
  (`NiSaṃ zu Su, Cik., 27, 2.1`) shows it's Ḍalhaṇa's commentary ON
  Suśrutasaṃhitā — filed there instead. Also registered two taxonomy
  nodes (`vasistha_smriti`, `baudhayana_smriti`) that had no
  `library.json` catalog entry at all, a gap unrelated to DCS. No DCS
  match for the dharmaśāstra-nibandha cluster (Dāyabhāga/Mitākṣarā/
  Kalpataru/Nirṇayasindhu/Dharmasindhu/Smṛticandrikā/Caturvargacintāmaṇi)
  or for Parāśarasmṛtiṭīkā (DCS has it, but the existing `parashara_smriti`
  leaf is flat with no mula/tika substructure, and restructuring an
  already-live leaf just for one commentary was out of scope this round).

  **Batch 8 (Tantra/Śaiva-Śākta, deferred every batch until explicitly
  green-lit this round)**: `agama.pancharatra.shaiva_agama`/`shakta_agama`
  reparented to `agama.shaiva_agama`/`shakta_agama` directly — they'd
  been nested under the Vaiṣṇava-specific "pancharatra" despite holding
  Śaiva/Śākta content, a mismatch flagged since the original
  taxonomy-placement proposal. `shaiva_agama` already had real content
  (Śivasūtra) — moved as a whole leaf rather than restructured
  internally, to limit disruption to already-live paths. New branches:
  `agama.pashupata` (Pāśupatasūtra + Pañcārthabhāṣya + Gaṇakārikā +
  Ratnaṭīkā), `agama.pratyabhijna` (Spandakārikā + Nirṇaya,
  Śivasūtravārtika, Tantrāloka, Tantrasāra, Saṃvitsiddhi),
  `agama.shaiva_siddhanta` (Mṛgendratantra + ṭīkā), `agama.shakta_agama`
  now populated as a container (Mahācīnatantra, Mātṛkābhedatantra,
  Toḍalatantra, Uḍḍāmareśvaratantra, Devīkālottarāgama, Śāktavijñāna),
  `agama.natha_sampradaya` for the Haṭha-yoga/Nāth cluster
  (Amaraughaśāsana + commentary, Gorakṣaśataka, Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā,
  Haṭhayogapradīpikā, Vātūlanāthasūtras + vṛtti — this last grouping is
  this session's own organizational judgment, not a scholarly claim
  about doctrinal affiliation).

  **Every placement checked against its own DCS chapter header, not its
  name — caught a real one**: "Sātvatatantra" reads Śākta/generic by
  name, but its content is unambiguously Vaiṣṇava (full daśāvatāra
  doctrine, "iti śrī Sātvatatantre Śivanāradasaṃvāde", vaikuṇṭhaloka,
  puruṣottama throughout) — it's the Sāttvata Saṃhitā, one of the three
  ratna-traya Pāñcarātra āgamas, and fills the *existing* empty
  `sattvata_samhita` leaf instead of landing anywhere near Śākta. Two
  more corrections the same way: "Sphuṭārthāvyākhyā" sounds Śaiva/generic
  but its chapter line is `zu AbhidhKo` — Yaśomitra's sub-commentary on
  Abhidharmakośa (Buddhist), filed under `shastra.bauddha_sahitya`
  instead. "Yogaratnākara" sounds like Haṭha-yoga by name, but its
  content and chapter tag (`YRā, Dh.`) are Āyurvedic (a medical
  formulary, "yoga" here meaning *formulation* not Patañjali-style
  discipline) — filed under Āyurveda. Two attributions are inferred from
  a text's standard scholarly name rather than confirmed by DCS's own
  metadata (Pañcārthabhāṣya → Kauṇḍinya, Mṛgendraṭīkā → Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha),
  flagged as such, not asserted as fact.

  **Pañca Mahākāvya**: checked first — Raghuvaṃśa, Kumārasambhava,
  Kirātārjunīya, Śiśupālavadha are *already* `populated: true`. Only
  Naiṣadhīyacarita (Śrīharṣa) is missing, and DCS doesn't carry it at
  all (checked by listing) — a genuine gap needing a non-DCS source
  (e.g. GRETIL), not filled here. **Still the one open ask from this
  round with nothing done about it.**

  **Unplaceable singles, re-researched** (wisdomlib + secondary
  sources): Kṛṣiparāśara (agriculture, high confidence) →
  `shastra.krishi_shastra`; Śyainikaśāstra (falconry, Rāja Rudradeva of
  Kumaon, high confidence) → `shastra.shainika_shastra`;
  Agastīyaratnaparīkṣā (Hindu, not Jain, gemology, medium-high
  confidence) → new `shastra.ratna_pariksha.agastiya`; Āyurvedarasāyana
  — resolves the earlier "zu AHS" puzzle: it's Hemādri's own
  Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya commentary, not a standalone rasāyana text, high
  confidence → new tika leaf under `ashtanga_hridaya_samhita`;
  Gṛhastharatnākara (Caṇḍeśvara's dharmaśāstra nibandha, part of his
  *Smṛtiratnākara*, high confidence) → new `smriti_dharma.dharmashastra`
  leaf. Ratnadīpikā stays low-confidence on author/sect (research
  couldn't settle Jain vs. Hindu from open sources) but genre (gemology)
  is solid enough to file → `shastra.ratna_pariksha.ratnadipika`, with
  the uncertainty carried in its own title/notes rather than hidden.

  **Skandapurāṇa/Śivapurāṇa** (separate research pass against wisdomlib/
  GRETIL/the Skandapurāṇa Project): plain "Skandapurāṇa" (24 bare-numbered
  chapters) is a different, uncitable recension entirely — not mapped.
  "Śivapurāṇa" is a single chapter labelled with a saṃhitā name outside
  the standard 7-saṃhitā scheme, unverifiable and too little content to
  matter — not mapped. **"Skandapurāṇa (Revākhaṇḍa)" is a clean, citable
  1:1 whole-text match** — DCS's 232 chapters are wisdomlib's complete
  Revākhaṇḍa, confirmed independently against GRETIL's e-text of the
  same material — imported as a new `purana.skanda_purana.revakhanda`
  leaf (231 files found, 7,894 items). Carried forward honestly, not
  smoothed over: GRETIL notes the print tradition may have misattributed
  this material from the Vāyupurāṇa — noted in the item's own title.

  `tools/dcs/build_batch7_smriti.py`, `build_batch8_tantra_and_misc.py`;
  38/39 matched across both (one filename-diacritic slip on
  Āyurvedarasāyana, corrected inline). DCS running total: **160 texts,
  172 taxonomy leaves, 186,139 items.**

- **23 Aug (same session): the sandhi feature's real-browser test,
  attempted and partially completed — the live network call could not
  be exercised end to end, but the code was verified correct against
  the real API by a different route.** A headless Chromium launched via
  Playwright still cannot reach the network from inside this sandbox —
  confirmed independently a second time, with more mitigation attempted
  than the first pass (a local HTTP server for `dge/index.html`, then
  `--proxy-server`/`--proxy-bypass-list` pointed at the session's own
  working `HTTPS_PROXY`, plus `--ignore-certificate-errors` for the
  proxy's re-terminated TLS): every request failed, including to
  `localhost:8899` itself, not just `dharmamitra.org` — this reads as a
  sandbox-level restriction on the browser subprocess's networking, not
  anything fixable from inside the page or the launch flags.

  **Substituted two narrower checks that don't need the browser to have
  network access, both real, neither fabricated:**
  1. Called the live `dharmamitra.org` endpoint directly with `curl`
     (which *can* reach it, through the session's normal proxy) using
     `sandhi.js`'s exact request body, for the Gītā's opening
     "dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ". Real response in
     0.96s: 5 words, each with `lemma`/`unsandhied`/`tag` — exactly the
     shape `dgeFetchSandhiAnalysis`/`dgeRenderSandhiResult` expect, and
     grammatically correct (e.g. `yuyutsavaḥ` correctly lemmatized to
     the desiderative `yuyutsu`). A malformed-Sanskrit input also
     round-tripped correctly, returning the `notice` field the "no
     analysis" fallback path reads.
  2. Loaded `sandhi.js` itself (unmodified) into a real Chromium page
     (via `page.addScriptTag`, no fetch involved) and called
     `dgeRenderSandhiResult()` directly with that *real, captured* API
     response — confirming the DOM it builds is correct and safely
     escaped (checked for injection), for both the successful-analysis
     path and the notice/fallback path.

  **Net verdict: the code is correct against the real, live API
  contract — request format, response shape, rendering, and the error
  fallback all check out — but nobody has watched a real click-to-select
  flow complete against the live network end-to-end in an actual browser
  yet**, only its two halves separately. A real user's browser (unlike
  this sandbox) has no such network restriction, so this is very likely
  fine — but "very likely fine" is short of "watched it work," and
  that's the honest gap left here for whoever can run it from an
  unrestricted browser next.

- **23 Aug (same session): the Pañcarātra Saṃhitā cluster — asked
  directly to fill in "Sāttvata Saṃhitā and any others available in
  GRETIL etc."** Checked DCS first (quick, already had the mirror):
  nothing else Pāñcarātra-shaped there beyond Sāttvatatantra, already
  imported in batch 8. GRETIL is a *different* source with its own
  licence to verify per file — not assumed to inherit the one already-
  imported Pāñcarātra Saṃhitā's terms (Prakāśasaṃhitā, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)
  just because both are GRETIL.

  **Checked GRETIL's actual Vaiṣṇava-section catalog directly for all
  13 still-empty named Saṃhitās (Ahirbudhnya, Hayagrīva, Īśvara,
  Jayākhya, Lakṣmītantra, Nāradīya, Padma, Parama, Pārāśara, Pauṣkara,
  Vāsiṣṭha, Viṣṇu, Viśvaksena) — only 2 have a GRETIL e-text at all.**
  Two near-misses caught and correctly **not** used as substitutes:
  GRETIL's "Jñānāmṛtasārasaṃhitā" is Nārada-Pāñcarātra-*adjacent* but a
  different text from the Nāradīyasaṃhitā itself; its
  "Parāśaradharmasaṃhitā" is Parāśara's *dharmaśāstra* smṛti (already
  handled — see the batch 7 entry above), not the Pāñcarātra
  Pārāśarasaṃhitā. The other 9 named Saṃhitās simply aren't on GRETIL —
  confirmed by reading the catalog, not by a search coming up empty.

  **Imported the 2 real matches, licence verified directly from each
  file's own TEI `<availability>` element** (both state the same CC
  BY-NC-SA 4.0 as Prakāśasaṃhitā, confirmed rather than presumed):
  Viśvaksenasaṃhitā (complete, 39 adhyāyas, 3,796 śloka) and
  Pauṣkarasaṃhitā (**partial** — GRETIL only carries adhyāyas 27–43 of
  the printed edition, P.P. Apte's Tirupati 2006 edition; adhyāyas 1–26
  and beyond 43 are not part of this e-text at all, a real gap in the
  source, not something introduced here or hidden — noted explicitly in
  the item's own metadata, not just in this log). Built with a new,
  purpose-specific parser
  (`tools/gretil_pancharatra/build_pancharatra.py`) rather than forcing
  either the DCS pipeline or `tools/kavya/`'s convention-detection
  parser onto GRETIL's `// Vis_1.1 //`-style bare reference — output
  matches Prakāśasaṃhitā's own existing on-disk shape exactly, so all 3
  Pāñcarātra Saṃhitā leaves in this repo now share one internal
  convention. Content spot-checked, not just validated: Viṣvaksena 1.1
  opens with the expected topic (*bhūparīkṣā*, site examination before
  construction) and Pauṣkara 27.1 opens mid-śrāddha-discussion,
  consistent with its being a partial excerpt starting at chapter 27
  rather than a text beginning.

  Muktabodha Digital Library was flagged during research as very likely
  holding several of the remaining 9 (Ahirbudhnya, Jayākhya, Lakṣmītantra
  are commonly digitized there) under a stated CC BY-NC 4.0 site
  licence, but its texts sit behind a login-gated access point — could
  not confirm per-text URLs or licence terms without an account, so
  nothing was imported from there. **Left as a genuine lead for whoever
  has Muktabodha access next, not acted on.**

- **24 Aug (same thread): asked directly to "check Muktabodha access
  options... also other related sources... wikisource or wisdomlib etc."**
  Muktabodha remains blocked on the same login gate — flagged for the
  project lead, not pursued further without their explicit go-ahead
  (would need account credentials this session doesn't have and shouldn't
  guess at). wisdomlib.org carries several of the remaining Saṃhitās but
  states no licence anywhere on the site — checked directly, not assumed
  absent — so per this repo's own rule (`dge/kosha_toolkit/LICENSING.md`:
  no explicit licence = do not use), nothing was taken from it. One
  archive.org scan of Īśvarasaṃhitā is explicitly **CC BY-NC-ND 3.0**
  (non-commercial, no-derivatives) — also correctly left unused, and its
  OCR is Devanagari-garbled enough (checked the `_djvu.txt` directly) that
  it wouldn't be usable even under a compatible licence without a real
  re-OCR pipeline, out of scope here. Paramasaṃhitā, Hayagrīvasaṃhitā and
  the Pāñcarātra-recension Vāsiṣṭhasaṃhitā: no Sanskrit e-text found
  anywhere checked (GRETIL, Muktabodha's public listing, Wikisource,
  wisdomlib, archive.org, TITUS, SARIT) — genuinely unavailable, not a
  missed search.

  **Sanskrit Wikisource confirmed usable — CC BY-SA 4.0 site-wide**,
  checked directly via the MediaWiki API
  (`action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=rightsinfo`) rather than assumed
  from Wikimedia's general reputation. Five of the remaining Saṃhitās are
  there in full: Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā, Jayākhyasaṃhitā, Lakṣmītantram,
  Padmasaṃhitā, Viṣṇusaṃhitā. Built a new importer
  (`tools/wikisource_pancharatra/fetch_and_build.py`) rather than reusing
  the GRETIL one — Wikisource wikitext needs its own parsing entirely
  (page-per-chapter fetch over the API, `<poem>` block extraction,
  footnote-apparatus stripping, editorial-subheading stripping — none of
  which the GRETIL TEI parser does or needs), and the source text is
  already Devanagari, not IAST, so no transliteration step either.

  **Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā run to completion first: 62 items (60 adhyāyas +
  the appendix split into 2 sub-items), 4,091 śloka total, no chapter
  silently skipped.** Six distinct real formatting quirks found and fixed
  by checking actual page wikitext against a failing chapter, never
  assumed — this source turned out to mix several different transcription
  conventions across chapters 1–60, apparently reflecting different
  Wikisource contributors' individual habits over time:
  - Two verse-ref bracket conventions in the same work — Devanagari
    daṇḍa+period (`।। 1.1 ।।`, most chapters) vs ASCII pipe+hyphen
    (`|| 43-1 ||`, ch. 43 on) vs the two characters mixed within one
    closing pair (`।| ४५-१।|`, ch. 45+) — generalized to treat `।` and `|`
    as interchangeable rather than special-casing each pairing as found.
  - The precomposed Unicode double-daṇḍa (U+0965 `॥`) vs two single
    daṇḍas typed in a row (U+0964 `।।`) — visually identical, only the
    latter matched every downstream daṇḍa-counting rule until ch. 50 came
    back with real content but zero parsed verses and this was checked
    directly; now normalized to `।।` immediately after extraction.
  - Footnote-apparatus blocks delimited by a dash-line
    (`---------`) almost everywhere, but by an underscore-line
    (`__________________`) in ch. 59 specifically — both characters now
    accepted as the same paired delimiter.
  - Ch. 59's own page is missing its closing `</poem>` tag entirely (the
    real content sits between the first `<poem>` and a second, stray,
    empty `<poem>` right at the end of the page) — a genuine source-page
    defect, not a parsing convention; handled by ending the poem block at
    whichever comes first, an actual `</poem>`, another `<poem>`, or the
    end of the page.
  - The parishishtam (appendix) page is not a 61st adhyāya — it's the
    *Sudarśana-sahasranāma-stotra*, numbered with a single sequential
    verse number (`।। ११९ ।।`) rather than the chapter.verse pairs every
    adhyāya uses, and — checked directly — that page itself holds two
    independently-numbered sub-poems back to back (a 21-verse dhyāna/
    nyāsa preamble, then the sahasranāma proper, whose own numbering
    restarts at 1). Given its own ref pattern and split into two
    sub-items (`parishishtam`, `parishishtam2`) on a numbering-decrease
    boundary, rather than colliding both series' verse numbers together.
  - A sustained MediaWiki API rate-limit window, several times over,
    initially handled wrongly: an earlier version of `wikitext()`
    returned `None` for *both* "rate-limited past all retries" and "page
    genuinely doesn't exist," so the caller's "no parseable content" skip
    silently covered both cases — 23 real chapters got marked skipped
    during one such window and a wrong 36-chapter partial `data.json` was
    written and had to be discarded, caught only because 23 consecutive
    skips in a row was implausible enough to go check by hand rather than
    trust. Fixed with a distinct `RateLimited` exception on retry
    exhaustion; `build()` is now resumable via a sidecar
    `.progress.json` cache (gitignored, deleted on success) and only
    writes the final `data.json` once every page is confirmed fetched —
    never ships a partial text silently as if it were the whole one.

  Content spot-checked, not just validated against expected counts:
  ch. 59 (`पुरुषसूक्तश्रीसूक्तवाराहमन्त्रार्थनिरूपणम्`) opens on-topic
  with *puruṣasūkta*/*śrīsūkta* material as its own title promises, and
  the appendix closes with the sahasranāma's own colophon
  (`इत्यहिर्बुध्न्यसंहितायां... श्रीसुदर्शनसहस्रनामस्तोत्रं संपूर्णम्`) —
  both regression-tested together with every previously-seen chapter
  sample (1, 2, 38, 43, 45, 50) before trusting the fix at scale.
  `library.json`'s `populated` flag flipped for this leaf.

  **24 Aug (same thread, continued): Viṣṇusaṃhitā and Jayākhyasaṃhitā
  also imported from Wikisource.** Viṣṇusaṃhitā (30 paṭala, at
  `विष्णुसंहिता`) uses the identical `Title/पटलः N` index structure and
  the SAME chapter.verse ref convention as Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā
  (`।। 1.1 ।।`) — the existing parser worked unchanged: 2,588 śloka, no
  chapter skipped, content spot-checked, `library.json` flipped.

  Jayākhyasaṃhitā (33 paṭala, also at a flat `Title/पटलः N` index)
  turned out, checked directly rather than assumed from the shared
  index shape, to be a *different digitization entirely* — a critical
  edition with per-chapter single-number verse refs (`।। 1 ।।`, not a
  chapter.verse pair) and its own apparatus: inline variant-reading
  markers (digit, `*`, or bare, sometimes with no marker at all),
  whole-pada variants in round parens or square brackets, uncertain
  readings marked with a trailing `?`, bracketed section headings, and a
  bare "20-3" chapter-verse crossref tag trailing a danda. A new
  `parse_chapter_critical` (selected via `build(..., convention=
  "critical")`) handles this, landing on one general rule after several
  narrower ones each missed a shape found only once more chapters were
  in view: this source never uses `(...)` or `[...]` for real verse
  content at all, so every bracketed span — wherever it falls, however
  deep it nests — is apparatus and is stripped outright via a
  fixed-point loop. Paṭala 1 also turned out to hold two independently-
  numbered layers back to back (a 78-verse frame narrative, then the
  actual text restarting at 1) — the parishishtam's existing numbering-
  restart/series-split logic generalizes to this directly, tightened
  along the way from "any decrease" to "a restart to literally 1", since
  paṭala 20 separately turned out to label two different, consecutive
  verses both "3" (a genuine source duplicate, not a restart) — the
  looser condition had fractured it into 3 bogus series before this was
  caught by checking the actual output, not assumed correct from a small
  regression sample. Final result: 34 items (33 paṭala + paṭala 1's
  restart), 4,625 śloka, zero stray apparatus characters or suspiciously
  short verses across the whole corpus on a full-scale check (not just
  the 5-chapter regression set), `library.json` flipped. Full account of
  every bug found and fixed is in the git log for
  `tools/wikisource_pancharatra/fetch_and_build.py` (4 commits, 24 Aug).

  **Lakṣmītantram and Padmasaṃhitā, scoped but explicitly NOT attempted
  yet** — deliberately stopped here rather than rush a 4th convention
  without the same verify-at-scale discipline the above took several
  rounds to get right:
  - Lakṣmītantram is at `लक्ष्मीतन्त्रम्` (not the more literal
    `लक्ष्मीतन्त्र`, which 404s), 57 adhyāya, flat index, and shares
    Jayākhyasaṃhitā's single-number-per-chapter ref convention — but its
    own apparatus is a *tab-indented running commentary*, not a
    bracketed one: a footnote's actual text sits on a tab-indented line
    with no closing delimiter of its own (just ends at the line break),
    and at least one footnote block was found continuing across several
    *more* tab-indented lines quoting a complete extra benedictory verse
    under a `टिप्पणी` ("gloss") sub-heading — checked directly against
    adhyāya 1's raw wikitext, not assumed to match Jayākhyasaṃhitā's
    apparatus shape just because both share the same ref convention.
    Running the existing `critical` parser against it unchanged leaves
    this commentary leaking wholesale into the following verse's body
    (confirmed directly, not assumed) — a tab-indented-line-stripping
    rule is the obvious next step, but needs the same multi-sample
    verification the Jayākhyasaṃhitā apparatus took 3 rounds to get
    right before it can be trusted, particularly since a verse pada
    being *itself* tab-indented somewhere in this text (as happens in
    Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā's dialogue continuations) hasn't yet been ruled
    out.
  - **Padmasaṃhitā, follow-up same day: its pāda-page structure and per-
    pāda conventions now actually confirmed** (the rate-limit window
    blocking this earlier cleared) — and it turns out to need
    meaningfully more than a second `subpage_list()` traversal level.
    82 chapters total across 4 pādas: योगपादः (5), क्रियापादः (32),
    ज्ञानपादः (12), चर्यापादः (33). Every pāda's own chapter pages live
    at a *bare* `<pāda>/अध्यायः N` title with no `पद्मसंहिता/` prefix at
    all, regardless of pāda — but the pāda *index* page itself is only
    reachable that way for योगपादः; क्रियापादः, ज्ञानपादः and चर्यापादः
    only resolve at `पद्मसंहिता/<pāda>` (confirmed for क्रियापादः: the
    bare title `क्रियापादः` exists too, but is a genuine MediaWiki
    redirect to `पद्मसंहिता/क्रियापादः` — checked via the API's own
    short-URL resolution, not assumed from the page shape alone). All 4
    sampled pādas use the same chapter.verse ref pairing
    Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā/Viṣṇusaṃhitā do (`।। 1.1 ।।`) — but ज्ञानपादः
    adhyāya 1 was directly seen dropping the chapter prefix on at least
    one verse (`।। 10 ।।` instead of `।। 1.10 ।।`), which the existing
    `REF_RX` (requires both parts) would silently merge into the next
    verse rather than flag, the same class of gap Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā's
    own ref-format variants turned out to be. Far more work than that,
    though: each pāda uses a genuinely **different** section-heading
    delimiter, checked directly against a real chapter from each rather
    than assumed to match across pādas of the same work — योगपादः wraps
    headings in asterisks (`* निश्रेयससाधनयोग निरूपणम्*`); क्रियापादः
    headings carry no delimiter at all, just a bare trailing "." instead
    of a daṇḍa (`स्थानद्यैविध्यम्.`), and aren't reliably isolated by
    blank lines the way Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā's own no-punctuation
    subheadings are; ज्ञानापादः's sampled chapter carries no section
    headings at all; चर्यापादः wraps headings in double pipes, tab-
    indented (`|| भगवता स्वाराधनाधिकारि निरूपणम्.||`). Four different
    heading conventions inside one work is more inconsistency than any
    text handled today, including Jayākhyasaṃhitā's own apparatus
    variety — realistically each pāda needs its own verified stripping
    rule (or at least its own regression sample), not one shared rule
    the way `parse_chapter`/`parse_chapter_critical` cover several
    chapters each. Left unattempted this session on purpose rather than
    rush a fourth-and-a-half convention without per-pāda verification;
    the concrete next step for whoever picks this up is to build and
    verify one pāda's parser at a time, starting with योगपादः (only 5
    chapters, simplest sampled convention) before attempting the larger,
    messier क्रियापादः/चर्यापादः.

- **24 Aug (same thread, continued): asked directly to finish all of the
  above and move on.** Built and verified all four remaining pieces
  rather than stopping at scoping — Padmasaṃhitā's 4 padas and
  Lakṣmītantram both shipped this same session, on top of
  Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā/Viṣṇusaṃhitā/Jayākhyasaṃhitā earlier. Every
  Pāñcarātra Āgama Saṃhitā leaf reachable from a licence-clear source is
  now populated.

  **Padmasaṃhitā: one shared parser covers all 4 padas after all**,
  contrary to the earlier note above — the 4 heading conventions
  (asterisk-wrapped, bare-trailing-period, none, double-pipe) turned out
  to differ only in *delimiter shape*, not in kind: a heading line never
  carries a daṇḍa/pipe (real verse text always does), so one rule
  recognizing several delimiter shapes together covers all four padas
  without needing to know which pada a given page belongs to. 82 items
  (yoga 5, kriya 32, jnana 12, charya 33 — matching the index page
  counts exactly), 9,096 śloka, checked at full scale rather than
  trusted from the small regression sample — three real bugs only
  surfaced there:
  - Kriyapāda adhyāya 16's own raw wikitext reads `।। 116.56 ।।` sitting
    directly between two verses correctly marked `16.55` and `16.57` —
    a source-side typo (an extra "1"), not a real chapter 116 out of
    32. Fixed generally rather than by hand: since the page's true
    chapter number is already known externally (from its own title),
    the parser now never trusts a two-number ref's own captured chapter
    digit at all, closing the whole class of typo.
  - A `*`/`?`-delimited heading can span *several* tab-indented lines,
    the opening delimiter on the first line and the closing one only on
    the last — invisible to a per-line check. Real verse text in this
    source is never itself tab-indented (the same property already
    relied on for Lakṣmītantram, below), so any tab-indented line is
    now dropped outright, subsuming the multi-line case without the
    unsafe alternative of pairing `*`/`?` characters across the whole
    poem.
  - A bare, unpaired `?` also turns up constantly *inside* verse lines
    themselves as an inline uncertain-reading marker (`जराया ? वा`,
    over 50 instances at full scale, concentrated in caryāpāda) — this
    is exactly why pairing `*`/`?` as delimiters directly would have
    been wrong; handled by stripping any leftover `?` only after every
    heading-line use of it has already been consumed.

  9 stray characters remain across all 9,096 śloka, every one checked
  against its own raw wikitext and confirmed as a genuine source-side
  unbalanced-paren typo (two footnotes merged onto one line sharing a
  single bracket pair, or an isolated unclosed paren), not a parsing
  gap — real verse content intact in each case, left alone rather than
  guessed at.

  **Lakṣmītantram: 56 adhyāya, 3,689 śloka.** Its apparatus (tab-
  indented running commentary, confirmed directly to leak into verse
  bodies under the existing `critical` parser) got its own
  `parse_chapter_lakshmi`: any line starting with a tab is apparatus and
  dropped outright, which also cleanly subsumes the multi-line `टिप्पणी`
  commentary block found in adhyāya 1. A third bracket-apparatus style
  turned up in adhyāya 25 specifically — curly braces used for the same
  inline-marker/footnote-line role square brackets serve elsewhere in
  the same work — added to Lakṣmītantram's own stripping loop, not the
  shared one the other three texts use, since none of those showed any
  evidence of needing it. Adhyāya 56's own Wikisource page carries no
  content at all (just the page header template, checked directly) — a
  genuine gap in the source transcription, noted in the item's own
  metadata rather than silently skipped. Adhyāya 57's closing verse
  fittingly echoes adhyāya 1's opening invocation verbatim — checked
  before trusting it wasn't leaked duplicate content, a real literary
  framing device instead.

  **What's still genuinely unavailable, unchanged from the research
  above**: Muktabodha (blocked on a login gate, flagged for the project
  lead), Parama/Hayagrīva/Vāsiṣṭha Saṃhitās (no source found anywhere
  checked), Īśvarasaṃhitā (one non-commercial archive.org scan, correctly
  left unused, and Devanāgarī-garbled OCR besides).

## Vedic-specific, still genuinely open

- **Sāyaṇa is missing on 164 Ṛgveda mantras (1.55%)**, and the gaps are
  explained rather than mysterious: the **Vālakhilya** (RV 8.49–8.55, 8.57, 8.59)
  has no bhāṣya on Wikisource at all — much of the manuscript tradition transmits
  it apart from Sāyaṇa — and 66 more are the first half of each **dvipadā** pair
  in RV 1.65–1.70, which the edition glosses jointly and DGE splits in two. The
  archive.org OCR route (`archive_sayana.py`, kept and unchanged) does cover the
  Vālakhilya and is the obvious next attempt if that gap matters.
- **24 Aug: `import_veda_phase2.py` finally run for real — Atharvaveda now
  has Whitney & Lanman, the rest are blocked, not merely undone.** Asked
  directly to work the queued Vedas backlog after finishing the Pāñcarātra
  thread above. The importer's own `av` (Griffith AV), `syv` (Griffith
  Śukla Yajurveda) and `ts` (Keith Taittirīya Saṃhitā) corpora all source
  from sacred-texts.com, which — checked directly by fetching a page raw,
  not assumed from a bare 403 — fronts every request with a Cloudflare
  "Just a moment…" bot-challenge page rather than serving content. Not a
  simple site block to route around (and not attempted to route around,
  since that would mean defeating anti-bot protection): genuinely
  unfetchable by an HTTP client from here, and likely from any similarly
  automated environment without a real browser. **Left for whoever can
  run this from a normal residential/desktop connection, or reconsider the
  source** — GRETIL hit the same class of block earlier in this project
  and was never resolved either, so this may need a standing workaround
  (a GitHub Actions runner, matching this project's existing pattern for
  GRETIL-blocked fetches) rather than a one-off retry.

  **`av-whitney` (Whitney & Lanman 1905, sourced from en.wikisource.org
  instead) ran clean**: 6,659 entries added across all 19 transcribed
  kāṇḍas (Book XX isn't on Wikisource at all, per the importer's own
  docstring), **99.4% match rate** (37 verse-level misses, 180 page
  fetches genuinely missing out of 586 attempted). This is arguably the
  more valuable of the two Atharvaveda layers regardless of Griffith's
  availability — Whitney's own critical notes are the ones that report
  Sāyaṇa's readings, per the importer's own header comment. Alignment
  spot-checked across kāṇḍas 1, 6, 10, 19 (right mantra's translation,
  no repetition or drift into a neighbor's content) before trusting the
  99.4% match-rate number rather than just reading it off the log.
  Śukla Yajurveda (1,975 items) and Taittirīya Saṃhitā (696) remain at
  zero commentary — both are entirely sacred-texts.com-sourced in this
  importer, so both are blocked by the same Cloudflare wall, not merely
  unattempted.
- **142 Sāmaveda mantras have no Ṛgveda parallel to inherit from** (114 carry no
  `rigveda_ref` at all, 8 have a bad one, 19 point at Ṛgveda mantras that are
  themselves in the Vālakhilya/dvipadā gaps, 1 unresolvable). There is no other
  route to a Sāmaveda commentary: Griffith follows Benfey's Rāṇāyanīya numbering,
  which does not line up with DGE's Kauthuma sequence.

(Full detail in `veda_toolkit/README.md` §7.)
- Accented padapāṭha, ṛṣi/devatā/chandas for Taittirīya — not present in
  its ITRANS source.
- Sāmaveda gāna (melodic notation) — deferred, needs its own accent
  handling.
- Missing śākhās (Rāṇāyanīya flagged as easiest).
- ~~Audio (recitation) — not sourced for any Veda yet~~ — partially
  resolved: VedaVaNi Rigveda + Yajurveda-Aranyaka audio sourced and
  verified (see above); Yajurveda Samhita/Brahmanam and full
  text/audio pairing still open.

## Dvaita Vedānta extraction — what Nyāya Sudhā left behind

Nyāya Sudhā is **in** (PR #80, merge `307d45f4`): 1,655 of 1,655 leaves,
0 failed, 46 layers, 9,929 entries, 43.6 MB. It had been shelved on 17 Aug
on a recon figure of ~105 s per leaf — about 46 hours. Measured against the
live site it is ~26 s per leaf when the site is quick and ~39 s at night, so
the real cost was ~14 hours, taken in five four-hour rounds against the
resumable HTTP cache. Concurrency does not help: four parallel requests took
70.9 s wall against 104 s serial, because the backend serialises. The
`_note` on `nyaya_sudha` in `dv_sources.json` has been corrected; the
grantha stays `enabled: false` because it is done, not because it is
impossible.

Fixed on the way, so nobody re-investigates it: **`EndFragment` clipboard
chrome**. Word brackets a pasted selection in `<!--StartFragment-->` /
`<!--EndFragment-->` comments, and upstream of dvaitavedanta.in the comment
delimiters were lost, leaving the bare words in the stored text — 1,590 of
Nyāya Sudhā's 9,929 entries carried one. On two short entries it dragged the
Devanagari ratio under the verifier's floor and failed the whole merged
tree, which is why a completed crawl produced no PR. `clean_text()` now
strips it (`d8075db3`); zero remain in the landed data.

Still open, in the order I would take them:

- **One layer per heading — the extraction's biggest structural problem.**
  The importer mints a layer from whatever heading string it finds, so
  section headings become "commentaries". Under `nyaya_sudha` the
  Nyāyasudhā-parimaḷa **was** split across three directories —
  `tika_nyayasudhaparimala`, `tika_nyayasudhaparima_a` and `tika_parima_a`.
  Root-caused precisely (25 Aug): not one OCR stray space but **two separate
  normalization gaps** in `layer_key()` — (1) `श्रीमन्` is the real sandhi
  form of `श्रीमत्` before a following nasal (`श्रीमत्` + `न्यायसुधा` →
  `श्रीमन्न्यायसुधा`), not a typo honorific `HONORIFIC_RE` failed to strip,
  and (2) ळ (retroflex la) vs ल (dental la) is a genuine, common
  Kannada/Marathi-region printed-Sanskrit spelling interchange, not an OCR
  artifact — this tradition's home region, so it recurs. A third gap, a
  heading that self-references the grantha's own title as a prefix, also
  needed stripping. Fixed in `dv_parse.py` (`HONORIFIC_RE` extended, ळ→ल
  fold added to `layer_key()`, new `strip_grantha_prefix()`) and wired into
  `import_dvaitavedanta.py`'s fallback slug computation; regression test in
  `test_import_offline.py` confirms all four real heading variants now
  converge on one slug (`parimala`). The three already-ingested directories
  were merged directly in the repo (no re-crawl needed): 1,449 + 2 + 1 =
  1,452 items into `tika_parimala/` (zero ID collisions), `default_author`
  filled in from the two smaller folders (`श्री राघवेन्द्रतीर्थविरचितः`,
  which the dominant folder was missing), `library.json`/`taxonomy.json`
  regenerated via `tools/audit_library.py --fix` plus manual removal of the
  two stale taxonomy leaves it doesn't auto-prune. `validate_data.py`: 0
  errors. Full `pytest`: 187 passed.
  Under `later_acharyas/karmavijaya` there are ~60 directories named from
  truncated summary *sentences*
  (`tika_prasangadasadadhikaraniyanuvvakhyanasudhaya_kartabuddhimanitishe`,
  `tika_om_na_prayojanavattvat_om_prayojanavattvahetoriti_sutre_prayojan`).
  Under `sutra_prasthana/anuvyakhyana`, 68 of its 70 layers are
  `tika_<adhikaraṇa-name>` holding one item each, and the text inside them is
  Anuvyākhyāna verse (numbered ॥244॥, ॥245॥), not commentary. The fix belongs
  in `resolve_layer_config` / the heading classifier — distinguish a
  commentator's name from a section heading, and fold OCR variants of the
  same name together. Nothing here is a fetching problem.
- **The window on cheap re-runs is open but closing.** Every one of the 1,655
  pages is in the Actions cache (`dv-cache-later_acharyas-*`, ~43 MB, scoped
  to branch `claude/task-review-completion-wqog9g`). A full re-run with
  `limit_per_grantha: 0` replays from it in **11 minutes** instead of 14
  hours, so the layer-naming fix above costs almost nothing *while the cache
  lives*. GitHub evicts caches unused for 7 days, and deleting the branch
  drops the scope with it — that is the one action that turns this back into
  a day of crawling. **Not used for the Nyāya Sudhā fix above** — that cache
  is scoped to a different session's branch (`claude/task-review-completion-wqog9g`),
  which this session has no reason to touch, so the fix was made directly
  against the already-ingested data instead of re-crawling. The cache
  opportunity itself is still open and still closing; whoever has that
  branch would need to act on it before the 7-day window lapses.
- ~~**Anuvyākhyāna looks under-crawled and is marked `complete` anyway.**~~
  **Re-checked against the live site (25 Aug), not just re-read from the
  status file** — this session had real network egress to
  dvaitavedanta.in, unlike the Cowork sandbox this pipeline normally runs
  in. Verdict: **`discovered: 16` is genuinely correct, not under-crawled.**
  The site itself exposes exactly 16 entry points for this grantha (4
  adhyāya × 4 pāda — the canonical Brahma Sūtra shape), confirmed three
  ways: the seed page's own sidebar, the book-root page
  (`/category-details/563/563/satara`), and the site's own homepage nav all
  list the same 16 links, and the `load-data` AJAX endpoint the site's JS
  uses to swap content (`loadArticle()`) returns nothing deeper for these
  ids either — there is no hidden per-verse tree a static-HTML crawl is
  missing. Fetched all 16 pages live and extracted every `॥N॥` verse
  number: they run gapless from 1 up to each adhyāya's own maximum (verse
  numbering restarts per adhyāya, not a single 1..~1900 run), summing to
  1,656 numbered verses across the four adhyāyas — in the right range for
  "roughly 1,900" once colophon/unnumbered lines are counted, not a
  fragment of it. The **88-item count undersold this real coverage for a
  different reason**: this text isn't captured one-item-per-verse the way
  most of this corpus is — each pāda page groups its many verses by
  adhikaraṇa into a handful of large multi-verse chunks (pāda 1 alone is
  12 chunks covering verses 9–256, 7.8 KB in its biggest chunk), so a low
  item count was never evidence of missing pages. Confirmed the item count
  itself reconciles exactly: summing each of the 16 live pages' own chunk
  count gives 88, matching the ingested total precisely. Four of the 16
  pādas (2.4, 3.1, 4.3, 4.4) genuinely carry only a bare pratika and no
  commentary at all live on the site — real pāda-length variance (some
  Brahma Sūtra pādas are far shorter than others), not a fetch failure.
  **A real, different, newly-found problem from the same check**: those
  adhikaraṇa-grouped chunks are filed as ~68 separate `tika_<adhikaraṇa>`
  folders (`dge/data/.../sutra_prasthana/anuvyakhyana/tika_*`, mostly 1
  item each) as if each adhikaraṇa were a distinct sub-commentary, when
  they are all still Anuvyākhyāna's own root verses just grouped by
  section — the same misclassification class as the Nyāya Sudhā
  layer-splitting bug fixed earlier this session, but for mūla-vs-tīkā
  rather than same-tīkā-different-folder. Worth its own pass: likely fixed
  in `resolve_layer_config`/`layer_key` by recognising that a grantha with
  no configured tīkā authors (only `mula`) should fold every unmapped h3
  heading into the mūla layer instead of auto-slugging a new tīkā folder
  per heading. Not attempted here — this was a re-crawl status check, not
  a classifier redesign, and 68 folders deserves its own verified fix
  rather than a rushed one bundled into an unrelated task.
- **94,829 units across 631 unmapped layer names are being discarded**,
  against 30,139 items actually written — roughly three times as much
  dropped as kept. The largest are the major ṭīkā corpus: भावरत्नकोशः 6,787,
  भावबोधः 6,358, भावप्रकाशः 5,500, भावप्रदीपिका 3,652, भावदीपिका 3,652. Some
  of that is commentary on works not yet mapped and is legitimately out of
  scope, but the volume deserves a deliberate decision rather than a silent
  default, and `failures: []` with all 56 granthas `complete` reads as
  fuller coverage than it is.
- ~~**The two verify gates disagree, and the looser one runs first.**~~
  **Fixed (25 Aug).** The extract job ran `verify_extract.py` without
  `--strict`; the collect job ran it with. So a shard's own errors printed
  and passed, and the failure surfaced only on the merged tree — after the
  crawl, in a job that cannot say which shard caused it.
  `extract-dvaitavedanta.yml`'s "Verify emitted data" step (the extract
  job, per-shard, before staging) now also passes `--strict`, matching the
  collect job — a shard with a real error (chrome scraped instead of verse
  text, duplicate ids, escaped `\uXXXX`) now fails right there, while the
  cause is still visible, instead of surfacing anonymously after the merge.
- ~~**Headings are stored as verses, which is what a reader sees as a blank
  entry.**~~ **Fixed (25 Aug).** Root cause, found precisely rather than
  guessed: the site marks a pāda/sarga/adhyāya section-boundary heading with
  the exact same `<h2 class="shloka">` markup it uses for a real verse, and
  `_layers_from_article()` in `dv_parse.py` blindly trusted that markup.
  Confirmed corpus-wide (all `dge/data/**/mula/data.json`, not a guess): 22
  distinct heading strings, all of the closed shape "‹ordinal› ‹पाद/सर्ग/
  अध्याय/अधिकरण/खण्ड/प्रकरण/काण्ड/अंश/अष्टक›" (e.g. "प्रथमः पादः", sandhi
  forms like "द्वितीयोऽध्यायः" too), zero false positives against real short
  verse/pratīka text on the same sweep. Added `is_structural_heading()` +
  `STRUCTURAL_HEADING_RE` to `dv_parse.py`, wired into the shloka-append
  check so a heading no longer becomes a fake mūla item — the real
  commentary sharing that article id (there always was some; adhikaraṇa
  ṭīkās comment on the pāda the heading marks) is untouched, since it comes
  from a separate `<h3>` pass over the same block. A heading-only leaf with
  no commentary at all now correctly yields nothing rather than a lone fake
  "verse". Regression-tested in `test_dv_parse.py` (section G) against the
  real heading strings plus the real DV_4841-shape article layout.
  **Also cleaned the 23 already-ingested fake items this produced** in
  DvaitaVedanta (`nyaya_sudha` ×5, `sumadhva_vijaya` ×16, `nyaya_vivarana`
  ×1, `gita_tatparya_nirnaya` ×1) — no re-crawl needed, the fake text
  carried no real information the breadcrumb doesn't already have.
  `sumadhva_vijaya/mula` is now honestly empty (all 16 of its items were
  this bug — its real kāvya verses were apparently never captured under
  these ids at all, a separate, deeper gap this fix only makes visible
  instead of hiding); `audit_library.py --fix` flipped its `populated` flag
  to `false` accordingly. `verify_extract.py --strict`: 0 errors (new
  "no matching mula item" warnings on the affected tika folders are
  expected and honest, not a regression — the same accepted class of gap
  already present elsewhere in this corpus).
  **New, out-of-scope finding from the same sweep**: `SarvaMula` — a
  different, already-existing corpus/importer under
  `dge/data/darshana/vedanta/dvaita/SarvaMula/`, unrelated to `dv_parse.py`
  — has the identical bug, 32 more fake items (`sutra_prasthana/
  anuvyakhyana/mula` ×16, `sutra_prasthana/nyaya_vivarana/mula` ×16, ids
  prefixed `BSNV_...` not `DV_...`). Not touched here: different pipeline,
  not investigated, worth its own pass.
- **The adhikaraṇa structure was never captured, and this is the deeper gap.**
  The breadcrumb goes `work > layer > adhyāya > pāda` and stops. There is no
  adhikaraṇa level, no link from an adhikaraṇa to the mūla sūtra/śloka it
  expounds, and no grouping of which commentaries belong to it — the
  adhikaraṇa names survive only as directory names invented from headings.
  So the corpus can be read page by page but cannot answer "how many
  adhikaraṇas are there, which verses does each cover, and which ṭīkās
  comment on it", which is the question a Dvaita scholar will ask first.
  Fixing this is a modelling job on top of the layer-naming fix, not a
  re-crawl: the pages are cached.
- **`sutra_prasthana/brahma_sutrani` remains disabled** — "homepage href is
  empty on the source site". Untouched by this work.

## Known unresolved bugs

- ~~**`taxonomy.json`: at least 47 `_default_author` fields hold mis-scraped body text, not an author name.**~~ **Root-caused precisely and largely fixed (25 Aug), not just re-flagged.** Re-walking `taxonomy.json` turned up a **much bigger, distinct, and cleanly-fixable bug hiding under the same symptom**: `dv_parse.py` hardcodes the h2.shloka mula layer's title to the literal `"मूलम्"` regardless of which grantha's page it came from, so it always resolves against the ONE canonical `"मूलम्"` entry in `dv_sources.json`'s `layers` map — whose author is Madhva. Correct for Madhva's own works; **wrong for every `later_acharyas` grantha**, whose root text is by that grantha's own later author. `dv_sources.json` already records the correct author per grantha in a `"acharya"` field (e.g. karmavijaya → Satyātmatīrtha) — it was threaded through the code into the `grantha` dict but **never actually consulted**, so the mula folder of every one of the 14 `later_acharyas` granthas with a configured `acharya` showed Madhva instead of its real author. Fixed in `import_dvaitavedanta.py`'s `build_items()`: the position-0 (mula) layer now overrides the canonical author with `grantha["acharya"]` when set, scoped narrowly so no genuinely-matched named commentary (Jayatīrtha's ṭīkā, say) is ever touched. Regression-tested end-to-end in `test_import_offline.py` (karmavijaya fixture, asserts Satyātmatīrtha not Madhva). **Backfilled directly** (no re-crawl needed — this is purely which author string attaches, not re-parsed content) in both `mula/data.json` and `taxonomy.json` for all 14 configured granthas: `shrimanmadhvasiddhantasaroddhara`, `sarvasiddhantasarasaravivecanam`, `brahmasutranyayasamgraha`, `shrimannyayasudhamandanam`, `bhagavato_nirdoshatvalakshanam`, `shrivijayindravijayavaibhavam`, `padarthasangraha`, `madhvasiddhantasara`, `bhedaparanyeva_khalu_brahmasutrani`, `candrikamandanam`, `madhvamukhalankara`, `karmavijaya`, `tantradipika`, `vagvajra`.

  Also fixed, the two entries the earlier investigation had already identified as recoverable (`tika_shrinivasatirthiyatippani`/`tika_nivasatirthiyatippani` → Śrīnivāsatīrtha via the possessive-suffix pattern) but had only folded into `dge/data/commentators.json`'s separate registry, never actually corrected in `taxonomy.json`/`data.json` themselves — done now, across all three granthas that carry this folder (`mayavada_khandana`, `upadhi_khandana`, `prapancha_mithyatvanumana_khandana`). Found and removed 3 stale `tika_shrinivasatirthiyatippani` taxonomy leaves in the process — an orphaned earlier spelling with no matching folder on disk (`audit_library.py --fix` only adds untracked folders, never prunes taxonomy leaves whose folder is gone, same class of leftover as the Nyāya Sudhā cleanup earlier this session). Also stripped 3 more clearly-garbage `_default_author` values to unattributed, where the folder name itself is fine but the field held a body-text fragment: `nyaya_sudha/tika_antasthatvadhikaranam`, `bhagavata_tatparya_nirnaya/tika_sumanoranjini`, `chandogyopanishad_bhashya/tika_chandogyopanishatkhandartha`. `validate_data.py`/`verify_extract.py --strict`: 0 errors throughout.

  **What's genuinely left, and deliberately not touched here**:
  1. **`karmavijaya`'s ~13 remaining `tika_*` folders** (the ones with body-text-fragment slugs like `tika_bahunam_vacanikarthanam_tatparyarthena_nigamanamiti_kham_cam_mat`) and **`candrikamandanam`'s 3 `tika_ramasubba_*` folders** — both the folder NAME and the author field are wrong, which is a structural mis-splitting bug (the same class as the Anuvyākhyāna adhikaraṇa-chunking bug above, task-tracked separately), not a bad-author-field bug a fallback string can fix. Patching just the author on a folder whose name is still nonsense wouldn't meaningfully help. Worth its own pass, likely alongside Anuvyākhyāna's.
  2. **11 more `later_acharyas` granthas still show Madhva with no `acharya` configured** in `dv_sources.json` (`bhedojjivana`, `dvaita_dyumani`, `nyaya_sudha`, `nyayamrita`, `pramana_paddhati`, `purushasuktam`, `sumadhva_vijaya`, `tarka_tandava`, `tatparya_chandrika`, `vadavali`, `yukti_mallika`). **Not all of these are actually wrong** — `nyaya_sudha` is a sub-commentary tradition (its "मूलम्" heading legitimately re-quotes Madhva's own Anuvyākhyāna verse being glossed on each leaf, confirmed directly against the live site this session), so Madhva is likely correct there. Others (`sumadhva_vijaya`, a biography of Madhva by Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍitācārya, definitely NOT Madhva's own composition) are almost certainly wrong the same way the fixed 14 were. Left alone rather than guessed at without the same direct evidence the 14 fixed cases had — each needs its own quick check against the live site or a real edition before a config entry is added.
  3. `dge/data/commentators.json` (the hand-curated registry, separate from `taxonomy.json`) was not extended with the 14 newly-corrected authors' works — still accurate, just incomplete.

- **`github-advanced-security` fails on every PR, and it is not any PR's diff.**
  GitHub's Copilot Autofix agent dies against its own backend with
  `CAPIError: 400 The requested model is not supported`
  (`COPILOT_AGENT_MODEL: sweagent-capi:claude-opus-4.6`). Confirmed not ours
  three ways: CodeQL's three real analyses (python, javascript-typescript,
  actions) pass on the same commits; PR #56 shows the identical failure and was
  merged anyway; and it failed again on a **documentation-only** commit in #57.
  Nothing in this repository can fix it — it is GitHub-side, and either it
  recovers on its own or the check wants disabling in the repo's security
  settings, which is the project lead's call. **Do not re-run it and do not
  re-investigate it**; check whether CodeQL is green instead.

- **Six things reported from a real phone on 18 Aug 2026, with two screenshots — noted only, not started, at the project lead's instruction ("just note these, I will give a go ahead shortly"). Each one was grounded in the code before being written down, so the next session starts from a cause and not a symptom. Where a cause is stated below it was read out of the source; where it is a guess it says so.**

  1. ~~Kosha: `अगस्त्य` returns no proper entry — it falls back to listing the top of the dictionary~~ **Confirmed fixed and re-verified, 20 Aug — see item 7 below for the fix and the fresh live-data confirmation.** The `claude/kosha-synonym-search` block this item once carried is also cleared: that PR merged as #47 on 18 Aug (`Find entries by their synonyms, and stop shipping 16MB search shards`), well before this check.

  2. **The Aṣṭādhyāyī page's AI settings offer four Gemini models that no longer exist, and default to a dead one.** Confirmed by reading the source, not inferred: `dge/ashtadhyayi.html` lines 106-109 hardcode `gemini-2.0-flash` / `-flash-lite` / `gemini-1.5-flash` / `gemini-1.5-pro`, and `dge/js/ashtadhyayi.js:197` defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`'s successor-in-name-only, `gemini-2.0-flash`. This is the **same bug already fixed once** in `dge/js/gemini.js` (v0.33.0 moved it to the rolling aliases `gemini-flash-latest` / `gemini-flash-lite-latest` after both hardcoded models returned a real 404 for a freshly-issued key) — the fix was applied to the shared client and this page's own private copy of the list was missed. So Aṣṭādhyāyī's AI is broken for any new key, in exactly the documented way. Small, isolated fix; worth doing first because it is certain.

  3. **Aṣṭādhyāyī needs Siddhāntakaumudī navigation alongside sūtrapāṭha order, and the number box should navigate.** The jump box already exists — `dge/ashtadhyayi.html:19`, `<input class="jump" id="dge-jump" placeholder="1.1.1" list="dge-sutralist">` — so "numbers editable" may be a discoverability problem rather than a missing feature; verify on the phone whether typing `2.3.16` there actually jumps before building anything. Kaumudī-order navigation is genuinely absent: the page reads `sutrapatha` order only, and the Kaumudī sequence is a different ordering of the same 3,962 sūtras. Note the earlier finding that vidyut's own data package bundles `kaumudi.tsv`, which is very likely the authoritative order needed here — that was flagged once already as "a real, promising follow-up" and this is the second time it has come up.

  4. **Intellisense is not reachable from the two pages where a reader would most expect it.** `intellisense.js` is loaded by exactly three pages — `dge/index.html`, `dge/krdanta.html`, `dge/prakriya.html` — and by neither `dge/ashtadhyayi.html` nor `dge/dhatu.html`. That is the whole of "unable to click a sūtra or dhātu": on those two pages the script simply is not there, so there is nothing to enable. `admin/config/intellisense.json` has no per-page switch either; it is on or off for the site. Two separate pieces of work: add the script (and a visible way to turn it on) to those pages, and decide whether the config grows a per-page list.

  5. **Dhātu page: prakriyā/forms wanted for all lakāras.** Currently `tools/build_prakriya.py` generates full step-by-step derivations for two lakāras only (`STEP_LAKARAS = ['Lat', 'Lot']`) and bare forms for the other six, a deliberate size trade — the full-step build was 116 MB against a 1 GB GitHub Pages ceiling the repo is already ~704 MB into. So this is not a switch to flip; it needs either better compression, on-demand generation, or a decision to spend the space. Also, `dhatu.html` does not link a root to its prakriyā at all, which is the cheap half and probably the real ask.

  6. **The magnifying-glass search returns no library results.** Two different searches wear a magnifying glass and it matters which one is meant: the reader's top bar has `#searchInput` ("🔍 Search text or shloka number…", `dge/index.html:188`) which searches **only the open grantha** and never the library — if that is the one, it is working as built and the ask is a real feature. The corpus-wide search is a separate floating 🔎 button injected by `dge/js/global-search.js`. One concrete suspect there: it resolves its index as `var INDEX_BASE = window.DGE_SEARCH_INDEX || 'search_index'` — a **page-relative** path, which is correct from `dge/index.html` and wrong from anywhere else, exactly the class of bug the script-URL-derived paths in `core.js`/`menu.js`/`keys.js` were introduced to kill. Worth checking the browser console for a 404 on `search_index/index.json` before assuming the index itself is stale. Separately, the landing page (root `index.html`) carries no search of any kind — if "main page" meant that page, there is nothing to fix, only something to add.

  **Worked through 18 Aug, one at a time. What each turned out to be, including two things recorded above that were wrong.**

  1. ~~Ashtadhyayi's AI settings offer four dead models~~ **Fixed (`b83600e`).** The list now lives once in `gemini.js` as `MODELS` and the page builds its menu from it, so it cannot drift again; a model saved by an older build is no longer honoured, so a reader who picked `gemini-2.0-flash` moves to the working default instead of failing forever. Only aliases confirmed against a real key are offered — a pro-tier alias probably exists, and deliberately is not listed until someone has watched it answer.

  2. ~~The jump box may be a discoverability problem~~ **It was, and it is now more than that (`bb76b0f`).** Typing `2.3.16` always worked; typing `2-3-16`, `2 3 16` or `2.3` did nothing, silently, which reads as a dead control. Any separator now works, a partial reference goes to the head of that adhyaya or pada, Enter fires even when the text has not changed, and a miss colours the box instead of sitting there.

  3. ~~Intellisense is absent from the two grammar pages~~ **Fixed (`adfe1ec`)** — and adding the script was the smaller half. It scanned two containers named for the reader's markup and read the grantha from a global the reader sets while navigating, so on a standalone page it would have loaded and done nothing. A page now declares itself: `data-grantha-slug`, `data-intellisense-roots`, `data-intellisense-search`. On the Dhatupatha page the vrittis turn out to cite sutras by name and never by number — checked across 400 vritti files, zero numeric references — so what it gets is name identification on its own search box.

  4. **A serious data bug found while doing (3), and fixed (`3e35114`): 1,019 sutras — a quarter of the Ashtadhyayi — carried their neighbour's analysis.** The enrichment from ashtadhyayi.com was joined to our mula by id, and the two number the text differently: ours reads उञ ऊँ as one sutra where the source counts two, so from there to the end of the pada every gloss sat one late. It resets at each pada boundary and starts again at the next disagreement, so no fixed shift could repair it. `tools/realign_sutra_enrichment.py` aligns the two sequences by their own text, pada by pada, and remapped 2,198 anuvritti references that were in source numbering. 22 sutras now show no gloss and 21 glosses match no sutra we carry; both are left as honest gaps. This was the reader's padaccheda panel too, not only intellisense.

  5. ~~dhatu.html does not link a root to its prakriya at all~~ — **that note was wrong.** It has linked to `prakriya.html#<code>` and `krdanta.html#<code>` all along, and both work: opened भू from the Dhatupatha page and got its derivation with all eight lakaras offered. ~~The real gap is the one already recorded — steps for two lakaras, bare forms for the other six — and that remains a size decision, not a switch.~~ **That size decision is now made — done, 19 Aug 2026.** The project lead explicitly authorized importing at whatever size is needed (same authorization that unblocked items 5/6 in the ashtadhyayi-com/data section above). Reran `tools/build_prakriya.py --lakaras Lat,Lit,Lut,Lrt,Lot,Lan,VidhiLin,Lun` (all 8, was 2) — `prakriya/` grew from 70 MB to 256.6 MB (measured directly; the module docstring's old 116 MB was an estimate for a narrower run, corrected in the same commit). Verified in a real headless browser: bhū's लुङ् tab, previously flat/unclickable, now offers a full step-by-step derivation (1.3.1 → ... → 8.4.56) identical in kind to लट्'s.

  6. ~~The magnifying-glass search returns no library results~~ **Fixed (`91c767b`), and it was two faults, neither of them the page-relative path I suspected.** It opened every grantha its candidates lived in — 444 unit shards for "राम", about ten seconds on a desktop connection, which on a phone is a search that returns nothing. And the scoring gave a substring match 0.8 plus a bonus for the unit being *short*, so "राम" ranked विरमति above every verse that actually says राम. A candidate must now share most of the query's trigrams before its grantha is opened, at most 40 granthas are opened, and a whole word beats a fragment. "राम" answers in under a second with राम राम महाबाहो at the top. Still 5–10 MB per search, because ranking needs each grantha's unit shard — cutting that means keeping enough in the postings to rank without opening shards, which is an index change and is left for its own pass.

  7. **Kosha अगस्त्य (`81344c4`) — both causes now confirmed, the second one on 20 Aug, against real production data.** Confirmed 18 Aug: the query is transliterated with Sanscript, which comes from a CDN, and when that fetch fails every Devanagari word answers "No headwords found". The app's own `dge-normalize.js` has a Devanagari table needing nothing external and is now used as the fallback; with the CDN genuinely unreachable, अगस्त्य returns its dictionaries. The second cause — keystrokes each starting a lookup with no ordering guard, so a slow one-character browse could land after the whole word and repaint, which is exactly what the screenshot shows — was flagged as unprovable at the time (the production index sits on jsDelivr, which this sandbox's *browser* blocks, and neither a local sample nor a synthetic slow index reproduced it). **Confirmed 20 Aug, once the `claude/kosha-synonym-search` block cleared (that PR merged as #47 on 18 Aug — nothing was actually pending here, the caution just hadn't been rechecked)**: `kosha.js`'s own `show(result, mine)` already carries the `seq` counter guard, with a comment literally naming this exact अगस्त्य screenshot symptom, so the race diagnosis was correct. Re-verified the whole fix chain end to end against the **real production kosha CDN** (`bhumandala-kosha-data@dist`, reachable from this sandbox over plain HTTPS even though a browser context here can't reach it) via a Node harness running the real `search()`/`toSLP1list()` unmodified: अगस्त्य now resolves to SLP1 `agastya` through the `dge-normalize.js` fallback with no Sanscript loaded at all, and `search('अगस्त्य')` returns अगस्त्य itself as the top, exact-match hit across 39 dictionaries — not the "अ, आ, aa, ai, अक, अख…" alphabetical-head symptom the phone screenshot showed. Nothing left to fix here.

  **Parallel sessions, checked at the project lead's instruction before any of this is scheduled.** Four others exist against this repo, three of them live, and two collide with the list above:
  - `session_017Vp35ezrDd5UeByjToL5uM` "Tasks to completion" — **blocked right now on a question awaiting an answer**: a wisdomlib import on GitHub Actions is failing every fetch (each page exhausting five retries) and will burn its 350-minute timeout importing nothing. It is asking whether to cancel. That one needs the project lead's attention before anything here.
  - ~~`session_01JVTFJzQMwCDFF2yTKLcAty` "Load unloaded libraries" — blocked waiting for `claude/kosha-synonym-search` to be merged~~ **Cleared, confirmed 20 Aug.** That PR merged as #47 on 18 Aug; this session's own status now shows it archived, blocked on a separate, unrelated matter (a network-policy setting for a different branch, `claude/deep-entry-buckets`) that doesn't touch `kosha.js`. `kosha.js` is no longer under any known collision risk.
  - `session_01BPDUCk8X9w2eSedhHQ23zt` "Dvaitavedanta crawler" — review-ready, reporting "17 orphaned folders from incomplete renames". Worth a look from this side too: this session moved the whole taxonomy, and orphaned folders from renames is precisely the failure mode that migration could have left behind.
  - `session_01PdaPRixnw1DeZv5kLia587` "Firebase auth" — review-ready, domain switchover tooling; overlaps the 29 Aug go-live checklist above but nothing here.

- ~~`index.html` caching — the version-check banner detects a stale
  cached app shell but can't rescue a tab stuck on one~~ **Fixed, 20
  Aug.** The banner's "Tap here to reload" called `location.reload(true)`
  — the boolean "force" argument is a Netscape-era relic no current
  browser honours; it behaves identically to a plain `reload()`, which is
  exactly the reload that got the reader stuck on the stale page in the
  first place (a normal reload can still be answered from cache — that's
  the whole bug this banner exists to catch). It now navigates to the
  same page plus a cache-busting query param instead — a URL that has
  never been requested before has no existing cache entry to be answered
  from, so it's guaranteed to reach the network. Verified in a real
  headless browser: forced a version mismatch, confirmed the banner
  appears, and confirmed clicking it navigates to `...?_dgev=<timestamp>`
  rather than silently re-serving the same cached document.

## Longstanding backlog, still not started

- True XML sitemap, IndexedDB migration for the main app, transliteration
  engine rework, waveform visualization, gapless audio, sponsor payment
  processing.
- **The biggest gap — content, not code:** most of the catalog is still
  empty — remaining Mahāpurāṇas, Itihāsas beyond Rāmāyaṇa/Mahābhārata/
  Harivaṃśa, most of Dāsakūṭa/Vyāsakūṭa/Sūtras/Pañcarātra Āgama/
  Dharmaśāstra/Smṛtis, plus "OCR tier" texts needing explicit sourcing
  authorization first.
- Sanskrit TTS/chanting: architecture doc only (`dge/tts/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  v1.1), no implementation started.
- Optional: Harivaṃśa's ~20-verse unmarked invocatory block could be
  split into individual verses with a verified daṇḍa-splitting heuristic
  (the text is already correct as one merged entry — this is a nicety,
  not a fix).

## Smṛti/Dharmaśāstra empty shelf — probed live 25 Aug 2026, don't re-probe blind

`tools/sayana_smriti/import_minor_smritis.py` was written by an earlier
session with no live network access, so its `--probe-only` result was
never actually verified. Ran it for real this session (`sa.wikisource.org`
does answer from here, though heavily rate-limited — expect long runs full
of retried 429s, that's normal, not a bug):

- **10 of 22 targets exist on sa.wikisource**: aṅgiras, dakṣa, yama,
  āpastamba, gautama, bṛhaspati smṛti; mitākṣarā, dāyabhāga,
  caturvargacintāmaṇi (a weak fuzzy-search match, see below), vīramitrodaya.
  The other 12 (atri, hārīta, likhita, pracetas, saṃvarta, śaṅkha,
  śātātapa, uśanas smṛti; dharmasindhu, nirṇayasindhu, smṛticandrikā,
  kalpataru) came back genuinely not-found even after retries — no known
  clean source for these yet, same as the script's own docstring already
  said before this probe.
- **Of those 10, only 4 actually parsed to non-empty text**: āpastamba
  smṛti (2528 units), mitākṣarā (8 units), vīramitrodaya (1 unit), plus
  gautama/bṛhaspati/dāyabhāga/caturvargacintāmaṇi all parsed to 0 verses
  and were correctly skipped (the importer's own "nothing parsed; not
  writing" safety, not a bug).
- ~~**Tried writing those 4 and reverted all of them — real contamination,
  not a quick trim.**~~ **Root cause found and fixed for one of the four
  (25 Aug), the real bug hiding under "8 units, mostly editor front-matter"
  — not a philology problem, a regex problem.**
  `parse_devanagari_verses()`'s marker pattern only matched a *bare*
  running-count `॥ N ॥`. Nibandhas and commentaries number by
  chapter.verse (`॥ १.१ ॥`) — Mitākṣarā's own convention throughout — so
  every such marker silently matched **nothing**, and the whole page fell
  through to "no verses". Confirmed directly against the live page (this
  session has real network access sa.wikisource answers, unlike the
  authoring sandbox that wrote the original importer): Mitākṣarā's
  Sadācārādhyāya subpage alone carries 302 real `॥ chapter.verse ॥`
  markers and 297 units of genuine Vijñāneśvara commentary on Yājñavalkya
  — the old pattern found 1, whose accidental span is exactly what read as
  "editor front-matter, verse numbering 7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" before. Fixed the
  pattern to accept the compound form (`tools/sayana_smriti/parsers/
  wikisource.py`); also added the general junk/OCR gate this task was
  actually named for — a chunk is dropped if it's a single
  editorial/citation/footnote line (variant-reading notes, footnote-style
  citations to a sibling smṛti, scan-tool credit lines) or reads as
  chrome rather than Sanskrit (below a Devanagari-ratio floor, the same
  `MIN_DEVANAGARI_RATIO` convention `dv_parse.py`/the DCS importers
  already use). 8 new tests in `tools/sayana_smriti/tests/test_wikisource.py`
  (compound numbering, plain numbering unchanged, multi-dot references,
  each junk class). **Imported for real**: Mitākṣarā, 776 verses across
  all 3 adhyāyas (सदाचार/व्यवहार/प्रायश्चित्त) — a nibandha folder that
  was completely empty is now populated. `validate_data.py`: 0 errors.
  (Minor, not fixed: the 3 adhyāyas' item ids are numbered by wikisource
  subpage-discovery order, not their true 1/2/3 sequence — the
  `reference` and each verse's own `number` are both correct regardless,
  so this is cosmetic, not a data-correctness bug.)

  **The other three are not fixed by this, and stay reverted/unwritten,
  for the reasons already found**:
  - `vīramitrodaya`'s page (re-checked live with the fixed parser) still
    surfaces real book-title-page/publisher-boilerplate content even past
    the new junk filter (only 20 chunks survive, one of them still "THE
    CHOWKHAMBA SANSKRIT SERIES..." front matter) — this scan's front
    matter is woven in more deeply than a per-line filter catches, or its
    real Śrāddhaprakāśa content lives on further subpages this page
    doesn't point to. Needs its own dedicated look, not a quick trim.
  - `āpastamba smṛti`'s problem (Haradatta's Ujjwala commentary and
    critical-apparatus footnotes interleaved with root sūtra across 2528
    units, plus real OCR corruption) is a different, harder kind of
    contamination than the regex bug above — line-level junk filtering
    won't separate three genuinely interleaved layers. Still needs the
    dedicated pass the original note called for, now correctly scoped:
    this text specifically, not "the importer" generally.
  - `caturvargacintāmaṇi`'s wikisource match is still the wrong work
    entirely (confirmed unchanged) — a title-matching problem in
    `find_title()`'s fuzzy fallback, unrelated to verse-parsing.

  Probe result cached at `dump/PROBE_minor_smritis.json` from the earlier
  session is gone (gitignored, session-local, different container) — not
  needed again since this pass re-probed live directly rather than relying
  on it.

**Also this pass**: checked DCS (`github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit`,
sparse-cloned — 271 files total, a curated subset not the full corpus)
for the same 22 targets. Confirms the 23 Aug session's finding: no
match for any of the 7 nibandhas or the 11 still-missing minor smritis.
But it turned up a real duplication: `smriti_dharma.smriti.
{apastamba_smriti,gautama_smriti}` were empty stub leaves whose actual
texts (853 and 891 items) already live, fully populated, correctly
classified under `vedanga.kalpa` (Āpastamba/Gautama are Kalpasūtra-school
Dharmasūtras, not independent verse Smṛtis). Removed the empty
duplicates rather than importing a second copy — see the git history for
25 Aug.

Also added `purana.vayu_purana` as an empty-but-visible placeholder — it
had no folder at all, unlike the other 17 traditional Mahāpurāṇas.

## Agama restructure (25 Aug 2026)

The `agama` taxonomy was flattening sectarian traditions (Pāñcarātra,
Pāśupata), scriptural corpora (Śāktāgama), and philosophical schools
(Pratyabhijñā) as if they were parallel top-level categories, and had two
real bugs independent of that: the Śiva Sūtra root text sat as a flat
`agama.shaiva_agama` leaf while its own commentary (Śiva Sūtra Vārttika)
sat under a different top-level node (`pratyabhijna`); and six genuinely
Śākta/Śaiva-Śākta tantric works were physically nested inside
`agama/pancharatra/shakta_agama/` on disk — a Vaiṣṇava folder — while a
*second*, empty `agama/shakta_agama/` sat at the top level as a dead stub.

Restructured into five top-level branches, each verified against primary
sources (GRETIL, web search, and each leaf's own `source_url` where it's
DCS) before moving anything — not a blind application of an external
recommendation:

- `vaishnava_agama` — Pāñcarātra (with its 15 saṃhitās, unchanged) +
  Vaikhānasa Āgama, un-nested from inside Pāñcarātra.
- `shaiva_agama` — now the umbrella: Śaiva Siddhānta (Mṛgendra Tantra),
  Pāśupata (Pāśupata Sūtra, Gaṇakārikā), and a new `shaiva_tantra` bucket
  for Toḍala/Uḍḍāmareśvara/Devīkālottara Tantra — all three were
  mis-nested under Pāñcarātra; GRETIL's own corpus placement is Śaiva for
  all three despite strong Goddess/Mahāvidyā content in some of them
  (deity orientation ≠ sectarian corpus classification).
- `shakta_tantra` — genuinely Śākta content only: Mahācīna Tantra
  directly, Mātṛkābheda Tantra under a `shakta_shaiva` sub-bucket (it's
  explicitly a Śākta-Śaiva/alchemical crossover work per its own
  literature, not purely either).
- `kashmir_shaivism` — new top-level branch, split out of the
  too-narrow "Pratyabhijñā" (which had wrongly been the parent of Trika/
  Spanda/Śiva-Sūtra material as if it were all one school): `pratyabhijna`
  (now correctly narrow — empty for now, no Utpaladeva Īśvarapratyabhijñā
  in the corpus yet), `spanda` (Spanda Kārikā), `trika` (Tantrāloka,
  Tantrasāra), `krama` (Śāktavijñāna — Somānanda's Trika text, misfiled
  by its title's "Śākta" word rather than its own school; Vātūlanātha
  Sūtras — Kashmir Śaiva Krama/Yoginī transmission, moved out of
  `natha_sampradaya`, where "nātha" had been read as the Gorakṣanātha
  lineage rather than the honorific it actually is here), and `shiva_sutra`
  (root + Bhāskara's Vārttika, finally together).
- `natha_hathayoga` — split into `natha` (Amaraughaśāsana,
  Gorakṣaśataka — the real Nātha scriptural corpus) and `hathayoga`
  (Gheraṇḍa Saṃhitā, Haṭhayogapradīpikā — classical Haṭhayoga manuals;
  real Nātha connections, but "Haṭhayoga text" is the more useful
  primary classification per their own content, a sevenfold/four-limb
  yoga system, not sectarian doctrine).

**One work moved out of `agama` entirely**: `samvitsiddhi` had been
filed under Pratyabhijñā by its title's "saṃvit" (consciousness) rather
than by its actual author or tradition. Confirmed via web search (GRETIL
identifies it plainly as "Yāmunācāryaḥ: Saṃvitsiddhiḥ", part of his
Siddhitrayam) and by reading its own opening line — it states the Advaita
*pūrvapakṣa* ("ekam evādvitīyaṃ tad brahma...") that the rest of the text
goes on to refute, exactly the Viśiṣṭādvaita polemical structure the
GRETIL attribution implies. Moved to
`darshana.vedanta.vishishtadvaita.yamunacharya.samvitsiddhi` — a new
Yāmunācārya node (Rāmānuja's guru's guru, previously absent from the
Viśiṣṭādvaita tree entirely).

**Not yet done**: the user's fuller two-axis proposal (a separate
`genre`/textual-form field — Āgama/Saṃhitā/Tantra/Sūtra/Kārikā/
Vārttika/... — plus a `deity orientation` field, alongside the primary-
tradition taxonomy path) is a real, separate piece of schema work, not
started this pass. `DGE_LEGACY_SLUGS` (`dge/js/core.js`) got redirects
for every moved path; three of them (pratyabhijna/natha_sampradaya/
shakta_agama) fanned out to multiple new homes, so their redirect lands
on the closest new parent rather than the exact leaf — a real, disclosed
limitation of the single-target redirect table, not a bug.

## Pancharatra regroup + "View By" facet metadata (25 Aug 2026, part 2)

Project lead's principle, adopted as standing policy for this whole
corpus: **the taxonomy tree should represent what a text IS** (the
authoritative single home for that file); guna (sattvika/rajasa/tamasa),
Madhvacharya-relevance, genre, availability, chronology etc. are *facets*
layered on top via metadata fields, never separate physical folders. A
text must never be duplicated across the tree because it also belongs to
a scholarly view.

Applied to Pancharatra now (low-risk, exactly specified by the project
lead — not a title/keyword-inferred migration): the 15 flat
`pancharatra_samhitas` siblings regrouped into `ratnatraya` (Sattvata,
Paushkara, Jayakhya — the traditional three Divya "jewel" samhitas),
`pramukha_samhitas` (9 other major named samhitas), `anya_samhitas` (the
remaining 3). Vaikhanasa Agama needed no change — it was already a
top-level sibling of Pancharatra under `vaishnava_agama` from the earlier
restructure, matching the "Vaishnava Agama = Pancharatra + Vaikhanasa"
principle.

Added independent metadata fields to every Pancharatra samhita + the
Vaikhanasa leaf's `data.json` (`genre`, `guna_classification`,
`ratnatraya` [bool], `madhvacharya_relevance: {level, evidence}`,
`text_status`) — all defaulted to `not_specified`/`false`/`unpopulated`
as appropriate, **nothing inferred**. Actually populating guna
classification or Madhvacharya-relevance (with real citation evidence, per the
project lead's "verified/probable/uncertain" confidence model) needs real
source work against Madhvacharya's own citations and is not started.

**Not started, real scope, needs its own pass(es)**:
- The "View By" UI itself — a facet switcher (Hierarchy / Guna / Madhvacharya
  relevance / Genre / Availability / ...) that regroups the Library tree
  display without touching the underlying taxonomy. This is genuine new
  frontend architecture, not a small addition.
- Same facet-metadata treatment for Purana (guna classification as a
  view, not `purana.sattvika/rajasa/tamasa` folders).
- Expanding the Pancharatra corpus itself (project lead's Priority
  A/B/C source list: Ishvara, Parameshvara already have empty leaves;
  Shriprashna, Bharadvaja, Sanatkumara, Kashyapa, Aniruddha, Vihagendra
  etc. don't exist yet) — via GRETIL/TextGrid, TTD survey, Adyar Library,
  Gaekwad's Oriental Series, Panchratra Parishodhana Parishad, per the
  project lead's specified acquisition pipeline, not sourced this pass.
- Vaikhanasa's own sub-corpus (Bhrigu/Marichi/Atri/Kashyapa-proktam) —
  explicitly flagged by the project lead as needing its own verification
  pass before populating, not to be built from a traditional 28-text list
  blind.
- Any migration report/validation step for reclassifying EXISTING
  content by guna or Madhvacharya-relevance, per the project lead's explicit
  "no destructive migration without a report + validation first" rule —
  not yet needed since nothing has been reclassified this pass, only new
  unspecified fields added, but binding on any future pass that touches
  these values.

## "View By" facet UI — built (25 Aug 2026, part 3)

The facet switcher from part 2's design is live: `dge/js/library.js`'s
Library modal category drill-down now shows a "VIEW BY" row (Hierarchy
plus one button per facet key any leaf under that category actually
declares) whenever `tools/audit_library.py`'s `derive_facets()` has
copied at least one non-empty `facets` object into `library.json` for a
leaf under that node — scoped to Agama/Pancharatra today, automatically
extends to any future section the same way once its data.json files gain
these fields.

Facets ride along on the catalog fetch the Library modal already makes
(no new network request) — `library.json` entries now carry a `facets`
sub-object (`genre`, `guna_classification`, `ratnatraya`,
`madhvacharya_relevance`, `text_status`) synced from each leaf's data.json by
both `register_layers.py` (new entries) and `audit_library.py --fix`
(kept in sync on every run via a new "facet metadata out of sync" check,
alongside the existing orphan/missing/stale/untitled ones). Selecting a
non-Hierarchy view groups the SAME leaves already in the tree by that
metadata value instead of by taxonomy path (`dgeRenderFacetView`) — no
duplication, nothing re-fetched, "Not specified" is a real bucket rather
than hidden or guessed.

Scoped to the grid category drill-down only, not the flat List view (a
facet grouping mixing unrelated top-level categories would be noise) —
a disclosed limitation, not an oversight.

Verified in a real headless-Chromium session (Playwright, driven
directly since `chromium-cli` isn't installed in this environment) —
screenshotted the Hierarchy view showing the new Agama branches with
their completion badges (9/15 etc.), switched to the Guna and Madhvacharya-
relevance facet views and confirmed the grouped leaf list rendered (34
leaves, correctly bucketed under "अनिर्दिष्टम्" since no real values are
populated yet), and confirmed a category with no facets at all (Vedas)
shows no View By row. One environment note for whoever re-runs this:
`js/vandana-guard.js` bounces a direct `page.goto()` back to the site
root (it looks exactly like an un-refferred deep link) — set
`sessionStorage.dge_vandana_passed = '1'` via an init script before
navigating, or the smoke test will only ever see the landing page.

**Still not done**: populating real guna/Madhvacharya-relevance values (this
was always separate, deliberately deferred work, not blocked on the UI);
the same facet treatment for Purana (guna as a view, not
sattvika/rajasa/tamasa folders) — the metadata-sync plumbing built here
is schema-agnostic and should need no changes, just `genre`/
`guna_classification`/etc. fields added to Purana leaves the same way.

## Per-section admin tracker: turned out to already (mostly) exist (25 Aug 2026, part 4)

Project lead asked for a per-section progress/sources tracker reachable
from each section's own top-right nav. Checked first, per the project's
own discipline, rather than building blind: `admin/library.html` ("Library
Manager") already IS a generic completion tracker covering every taxonomy
section uniformly (loaded/pending badges, item counts, search/filter,
expand-all) -- it just wasn't linked from anywhere in the reader, and
didn't show *sources*. `dge/dvaitavedanta-status.html` is a different,
narrower thing (a bespoke ingestion-pipeline dashboard tied to one
specific scraper's own `_extract_status.json` shape) -- not a template
for "every section," and left alone.

Filled the two real gaps instead of building a second tracker:

1. **Sources.** `tools/gen_library_status.py` gained `leaf_source()`
   (same file-resolution logic as its existing `count_leaf()`, just
   reading `source`/`source_url`/`licence` instead of counting items) and
   writes a new `leaf_sources` map into `admin/config/library-status.json`
   (1,038 leaves have one). `admin/library.html`'s tree rows now show a
   "🔗 source" link/tooltip per leaf when one exists -- no new fetch, this
   rides along on the `library-status.json` fetch the page already makes.
   `tools/audit_library.py --fix` and `register_layers.py` also sync a
   parallel `source` object into `library.json` itself (matching the
   `facets` field from part 3), for consistency and any future reader-side
   use, even though the admin tracker ended up not needing that copy.
2. **Navigation.** `admin/library.html` now accepts `?section=<path>` and
   pre-filters/scrolls to it, reusing its own existing search+auto-expand
   filter rather than a new rendering path. `dge/js/library.js`'s Library
   modal category drill-down gained a "📊 Progress" link in the top-right
   of the breadcrumb row (`dgeSectionTrackerHtml`), visible only to a
   signed-in **super-admin** (matches that page's own gate tier exactly --
   showing it to a lesser admin would just walk them into a passkey
   prompt), opening the tracker deep-linked to whichever section is
   currently open.

Verified in a real headless-Chromium session: confirmed the Progress link
renders with the correct `?section=` href from inside the Agama category
view, confirmed the deep link on the tracker side pre-fills the filter box
and scrolls to the right subtree, and confirmed source links render with
correct href/tooltip (spot-checked against Kashmir Saivism's leaves,
9 of which have one; `pratyabhijna`, still genuinely empty, correctly
shows no source link at all).
