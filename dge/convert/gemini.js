  // cross-check, when that opt-in was used); app.js formats those pages
  // with "[Vision]"/"[Tesseract]" labels. This prompt explicitly asks Gemini
  // to compare rather than blindly rewrite — per the project's OCR
  // verification policy, correction happens only where the readings agree
  // or context clearly resolves a disagreement, and every shloka gets a
  // self-reported classification instead of a silent, unqualified rewrite.
  const PROOFREAD_PROMPT = `You are proofreading raw OCR output from a scanned Sanskrit/Kannada devotional text.

Some pages below include TWO independent OCR readings from different engines, in this format:
--- Page N ---
[Vision]
<text>
[Tesseract]
<text>
Pages with only one reading show it with no engine label — there was nothing to compare it against.

Rules:
1. Correct OCR mistakes only (misread characters, broken/merged words, obvious scan artifacts). Do not rewrite, summarize, paraphrase, or "improve" the wording.
2. When two readings are given for a page: where they agree (even loosely, allowing for the kind of surface variation different OCR engines produce), that agreement is strong evidence — use it directly rather than inventing a third reading. Where they disagree, use context (grammar, known vocabulary, metre, the surrounding sentence) to choose the more plausible one.
3. Preserve Sanskrit and Kannada text exactly as intended — do not modernize or alter it.
4. Preserve the original paragraph and page order for the actual sentences/lines themselves.
5. Verse-number markers ("॥ १॥", "॥ २॥", ...) are a known weak point of the OCR layer, not something to trust blindly: when verse numbers are printed in their own visual column/margin on the page, OCR can read that whole column as one separate block and splice it back in slightly offset, landing a marker after the wrong shloka's last line. If this looks like what happened — numbers not incrementing where they visually sit, or a shloka reading oddly short or long compared to its neighbors — use the markers' own strict sequence (they always increase by exactly 1 within one sarga/chapter) together with where each verse's sense, grammar, and metre naturally complete to reattach each marker to its real shloka boundary. This only changes which existing text belongs under which "number" — it never means inventing, dropping, or actually reordering the underlying sentences (rule 4 still applies to those).
6. Where distinguishable, identify which portions are the mula shloka (verse) text versus commentary/explanation.
7. Never invent text that isn't grounded in at least one OCR reading for that page, beyond fixing an obvious small OCR-level error (broken characters, merged words) that context clearly resolves.
8. For every shloka, self-report a "classification":
   - "accept": the two readings agree, or only one reading existed and it's unambiguous and plausible as-is.
   - "review": readings disagreed, or a verse-marker boundary needed reattaching per rule 5, and you resolved it using context — likely correct, but a human should still glance at it.
   - "unresolved": you cannot determine confident text (readings are implausible, contradictory, or the source itself looks illegible). Keep your best-guess text in "sa" regardless, but do not invent details neither reading actually shows.
   Add a brief "note" explaining why, but only when classification is not "accept" — omit it (empty string) otherwise.
9. Also report which page (the number from the "--- Page N ---" marker) each shloka came from, in "page".
10. Watch for two specific structural problems, since they're easy to miss shloka-by-shloka but matter a lot downstream: (a) a chapter/sarga boundary — a chapter-opening line ("अथ <ordinal> सर्गः") or a closing colophon ("इति ... <ordinal> सर्गः") — that looks incomplete, garbled, or only half-legible, since that's exactly what breaks automatic chapter splitting later; (b) one verse's text that looks like it was actually split into two separate shlokas (or two verses merged into one) by a misplaced verse-number marker, beyond what rule 5 above already resolves. When either happens, still give your best-effort corrected text, but set "classification" to "review" and say specifically what you noticed in "note" (e.g. "possible sarga boundary here — colophon text looks incomplete" or "this may be two verses merged into one shloka"), so a human reviewer sees exactly what to double-check instead of having to re-read everything.
11. Output ONLY valid JSON — no markdown code fences, no explanations before or after, no trailing commentary.

Output exactly this JSON shape:
{
  "shlokas": [
    { "number": 1, "page": 3, "sa": "corrected shloka text", "commentary": "corrected commentary text, or empty string if none", "classification": "accept", "note": "" }
  ]
}

If a page doesn't cleanly split into shloka/commentary, put the whole corrected text in "sa" and leave "commentary" empty — do not invent a split that isn't actually there in the source.
