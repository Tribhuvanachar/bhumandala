# Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya Krama-pāṭha generator — corrected specification

_Written 10 Sep 2026, ~10:40 pm IST. Status: **specification only — no data digitized, no
code written yet.** This document exists because a first-draft Gemini prompt for "generate
Krama-pāṭha from Pada-pāṭha" was reviewed against the actual structure of Śaunaka's
Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya and found to skip most of the tradition-specific machinery. This is the
corrected spec a future session should build against — not the naive prompt._

---

## 0. What this replaces, and why

The rejected approach treated Krama generation as: take adjacent Pada words, apply a short
exception list, run generic Sanskrit sandhi, propagate a hard-coded accent-combination
matrix, emit `iti`-based Parigraha universally, and mix in audio timestamps and colour
markup at generation time. Each of those is a real simplification of a tradition
(Śākala Krama-pāṭha per Śaunaka's Prātiśākhya) that has its own dedicated chapters for
exactly these questions, plus a whole second chapter (Kramahetu) explaining *why* the
exceptions exist. Treating Pāṇinian/Classical Sanskrit sandhi as authoritative, or Parigraha
as `word + iti + iti + word`, will produce fluent-looking Sanskrit that is not the attested
Śākala Krama text. Section 2 below is the corrected rule hierarchy; section 9 has the full
list of what the naive version got wrong, kept for traceability back to the review that
produced this document.

---

## 1. Scope

This generator is specifically for the **Rigveda Śākala tradition** as carried by DGE's own
Saṃhitā data (`dge/data/vedas/rigveda/shakala_shakha/samhita/`). It is not a general Vedic
sandhi/accent engine, and it must not silently fall back to one.

---

## 2. Authoritative rule hierarchy

In order, highest first. A lower source may only be consulted where a higher one is silent:

1. DGE's own Rigveda Śākala Saṃhitā dataset (exists: `mandala_01`–`mandala_10`).
2. DGE's own Rigveda Śākala Pada-pāṭha dataset (**does not exist yet** — see §4).
3. Śaunaka's Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya, **Krama-Paṭala** (traditionally numbered Chapter 10, 22
   sūtras).
4. The same work's **Kramahetu-Paṭala** (Chapter 11, 71 sūtras) — the rationale-and-exception
   chapter; it is not optional colour, it carries load-bearing rules including the explicit
   Śākala catuḥkrama (four-fold Krama) practice.
5. The same work's Saṃhitā-Paṭala (ch. 2), Svara-Paṭala (ch. 3) and Sandhi-Paṭala (ch. 4),
   and the Nati/Dhvanyāgama/Pluti chapters (ch. 5–9) where a Krama/Kramahetu rule invokes
   them.
6. General Pāṇinian/Classical Sanskrit phonology — **only** where none of the above governs.

A generic Sanskrit sandhi library (if used at all) is a helper suggestion, never the final
answer: its output must pass through the Prātiśākhya-rule layer, which can override it.
Every non-trivial transformation the generator makes must be able to cite the sūtra(s) that
justify it (see §6.3, `provenance`).

### 2.1 Chapter map of the Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya

Confirmed from two independent secondary sources (`vedavishtaram.in/lakshanam/rp.html` and
`sites.google.com/view/rv-pratishakhya`, both consulted 10 Sep 2026) — **not yet cross-checked
against the primary scan**, see §4:

| # | Paṭala | Topic | Sūtras |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Saṃjñā-Paribhāṣā | definitions, conventions | 102 |
| 2 | Saṃhitā | continuous-recitation / vowel sandhi | 41 |
| 3 | Svara | accent | 26 |
| 4 | Sandhi | consonant sandhi | 94 |
| 5 | Nati | dental→cerebral etc. | 59 |
| 6 | Dhvanyāgama | inserted sounds | 56 |
| 7–9 | Pluti (I–III) | vowel protraction | 55 + 47 + 49 |
| **10** | **Krama** | **sequential (Krama) recitation method** | **22** |
| **11** | **Kramahetu** | **rationale + exceptions for Krama, incl. Śākala catuḥkrama** | **71** |
| 12 | Sīmā | boundary rules | 25 |
| 13 | Śikṣā | articulation | 48 |
| 14 | Ucchāraṇa-Doṣa | pronunciation errors | 68 |
| 15 | Oṃkāra | Om chanting | 33 |
| 16–18 | Chandaḥ (I–III) | metre | 88 + 48 + 58 |

Treat this table as **provisional** until the primary source is digitized (§4) — sūtra
counts and any specific sūtra text quoted anywhere in project notes must be verified against
it before being encoded as a rule, not taken on the secondary sites' word alone.

---

## 3. What "Krama is not simple adjacent pairing" means concretely

`W1 W2 | W2 W3 | W3 W4 …` is the structural skeleton only. A production generator needs,
at minimum, rule coverage for:

- Śākala-specific catuḥkrama behaviour (ch. 11).
- Avasāna/avasyā and ardharca-boundary handling — sandhi must **not** cross an ardharca
  boundary; this is a prohibition, not an omission to patch later.
- Parigraha — a multi-part rule set (bahumadhyagata, ardharcāntya, iti/setikaraṇa, compound
  puna-vacana, Pragṛhya-in-Parigraha, Śuddhākṣara-āgama, Rephita/ūṣman exceptions), not a
  single `word + iti` formula.
- Pluta exceptions.
- Nati and Dhvanyāgama transformations where a Krama-Paṭala or Kramahetu-Paṭala rule invokes
  them.

Do not implement Parigraha, Pragṛhya, or Rephi handling as a single universal formula or a
flat word list stands in for the phenomenon. A dictionary may **cache** known cases; it must
not **define** them.

---

## 4. Prerequisite data gap — checked against the repo, 10 Sep 2026

This generator cannot be built yet. Two prerequisites are missing:

| Needed | Current state |
|---|---|
| Rigveda Śākala **Pada-pāṭha** dataset | Does not exist. `dge/data/vedas/rigveda/shakala_shakha/` has `samhita/` only (mandala_01–10); no `pada/` sibling. |
| Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya **sūtra text** (Krama-Paṭala + Kramahetu-Paṭala at minimum) | `dge/data/vedanga/shiksha/pratishakhya/rigveda_pratishakhya/data.json` and the sibling `shaunakiya_chaturadhyayika/data.json` are both empty stubs (`"items": []`) — category placeholders only, no sūtra text digitized. |
| Digitization source | Already identified and logged, not yet fetched/OCR'd: `archive.org/details/pratisakhyarigv00sarmgoog` — Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya of Śaunaka with Uvaṭa's commentary (Benares, 1894), searchable PDF, public domain ("not in copyright"). See `dge/PENDING.md` §"Śikṣā + Prātiśākhya" (line ~378) for the full source table, including that GRETIL has nothing in this area. |

**Sequencing implication:** the Pada-pāṭha dataset and the digitized Krama-Paṭala +
Kramahetu-Paṭala sūtra text (at minimum) are both blocking prerequisites for any code in
this spec. Building the rule engine against paraphrases or a secondary site's summary risks
baking in exactly the kind of un-sourced simplification this document exists to avoid.

**Gemini-cost note (CLAUDE.md standing rule):** OCR/extraction of the 1894 archive.org scan
into structured sūtra text is a Gemini-calling task. Before running it, give the project
lead a cost estimate (page count × chars/page → tokens, ₹ at current Flash-class pricing)
and wait for go-ahead, exactly as for any other OCR staging job in this repo — do not run it
speculatively while drafting this spec.

## 6. Data model

### 6.1 Rule-driven predicates, not static lists

Encode context-sensitive phenomena as predicates over `(word, context)`, backed by named,
citable rules — a static dictionary may accelerate a predicate but must never stand in for
it:

```
isPragrhya(word, context)
isRephi(word, context)
isPluta(word, context)
requiresParigraha(word, context)
requiresCaturkrama(context)
requiresNati(word, context)
requiresDhvanyagama(word, context)
```

Where a dictionary is used as a cache, structure it by the kind of evidence backing each
entry rather than as one flat list, e.g. for Pragṛhya:

```json
{
  "pragrhya": {
    "lexical": [],
    "morphological": [],
    "phonological": [],
    "contextual": [],
    "shakala_specific": []
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Internal accent model — script-independent

Never use a Unicode glyph (Devanagari combining marks, IAST diacritics, or the wrong-block
`॑`/`॒` accent characters) as the semantic representation of svara. Represent
accent as a closed, named enum internal to the data model:

```
udatta | anudatta | svarita | dirgha_svarita | pracaya | kampa
```

(plus any further state the Śākala tradition is found to require once ch. 3 is digitized —
do not assume the list above is complete). Devanagari, IAST, and any pedagogical romanization
are rendering targets computed from this enum at the presentation layer only (§6.4), not
alternate sources of truth. Note for rendering once it is built: Unicode's Vedic Extensions
block (e.g. `U+1CDA VEDIC TONE DOUBLE SVARITA`) is the correct target for dīrgha-svarita in
Devanagari output — do not conflate it with the old two-character Devanagari tone marks.

Each generated token should retain, at minimum:

```
lexicalText, padaText, samhitaText, syllables[], svara[],
sourceSvara[], generatedSvara[], transformationHistory[]
```

### 6.3 Provenance on every generated unit

```json
{
  "source": {
    "samhita": "DGE-RV-SHAKALA",
    "pada": "DGE-RV-PADA",
    "pratishakhya": "Shaunaka",
    "tradition": "Shakala"
  },
  "generated": true,
  "generatorVersion": "krama-0.1.0",
  "rules": ["RVPr_10.1", "RVPr_11.4"]
}
```

`rules` cites Paṭala.sūtra identifiers so a "why was this generated this way" question has a
traceable answer once the sūtra text is digitized (§4) — do not invent sūtra numbers before
that; leave `rules` empty rather than guess.

### 6.4 Strictly out of the generator

- **Colour** is a renderer concern: the generator emits `{"svara": "anudatta"}`; a
  `[data-svara="anudatta"]` CSS rule (or equivalent) does the rest. This lets the colour
  scheme change without touching corpus data, and lets DGE offer normal / svara-marked /
  colour-coded / traditional-notation as display modes on one dataset.
- **Audio timestamps** are a separate alignment system's job, added after the fact against
  `{"pairIndex", "wordIndices", "text", "syllables"}` — not `data-start`/`data-end` baked in
  at generation time. Mixing text generation + phonology + svara + audio alignment + UI into
  one function is exactly the kind of premature coupling to avoid.

---

## 7. Two modes

**GENERATE** — Pada-pāṭha → Krama-pāṭha, per §5.

**VALIDATE** — authoritative (independently attested) Krama text → run the same input through
GENERATE → diff. On mismatch, report the pair index, expected vs. generated text, a
best-effort classification of what kind of rule the difference implicates (e.g. "rephi
handling"), and rule candidates from the digitized Kramahetu-Paṭala once it exists. This mode
is not optional polish — see §8, it gates every corpus-wide run.

---

## 8. Validation-first development plan

Do not run the generator over the whole Rigveda before this sequence, in order:

1. Digitize the Pada-pāṭha and at minimum the Krama-Paṭala + Kramahetu-Paṭala sūtra text
   (§4) — with a Gemini cost estimate and go-ahead if OCR is involved.
2. Implement RV 1.1.1 only.
3. Generate its Krama-pāṭha; compare against an independently attested Krama text for RV
   1.1.1 (VALIDATE mode, §7).
4. Write automated tests (`tests/test_krama_engine.py`, matching this repo's existing
   `tests/test_*.py` convention) for every Prātiśākhya exception RV 1.1.1 actually exercises,
   plus deliberately chosen cases for: Pragṛhya, Rephita, Pragṛhya-inside-Parigraha,
   compound-inside-Parigraha, pluta, svarita, kampa, a hard vowel-sandhi combination,
   consonant sandhi, an ardharca boundary, and Śākala catuḥkrama.
5. Only after those pass, extend sūkta by sūkta — not maṇḍala by maṇḍala — re-running
   VALIDATE at each step where an independently attested Krama text is available.

---

## 9. Corrections this spec makes to the rejected draft (for traceability)

Kept as a short index back to the full review, not restated in full here:

1. Add the Kramahetu-Paṭala (ch. 11) as a first-class phase, not an afterthought.
2. Replace the universal `word + iti + iti + word` Parigraha formula with a rule-driven
   subsystem over Krama-Paṭala 10.7–10.22 and the relevant Kramahetu-Paṭala rules.
3. Demote any generic Pāṇinian/Classical Sanskrit sandhi API to an optional helper,
   subordinate to the Prātiśākhya-specific rule layer (§2).
4. Replace the flat Pragṛhya word list with the categorized structure in §6.1.
5. Replace the static Rephi word list with an `isRephi(word, context)` predicate, list as
   cache only.
6. Treat any accent-combination ("Udātta + Anudātta = …") matrix as an unvalidated
   hypothesis, not ground truth, until checked against attested Śākala forms (§6.2).
7. Represent an Akṣara as a structured object (text/vowel/onset/coda/svara/…), not a regex
   match — the regex is a tokenizer only, never the phonological model.
8. Fix the transliteration/accent-encoding confusion: internal accent state is a
   script-independent enum (§6.2); rendering to Devanagari/IAST/Vedic-Unicode happens only
   at the presentation layer.
9. Add `dirgha_svarita`, `pracaya`, `kampa` (and room for more, pending ch. 3 digitization)
   to the accent model instead of collapsing to udātta/anudātta/svarita.
10. Move colour entirely to the renderer (§6.4).
11. Remove audio-timestamp fields from the generator's output (§6.4).
12. Require `provenance`/`rules` citations on every generated unit (§6.3).
13. Require a VALIDATE mode (§7), not GENERATE-only.
14. Require the Prātiśākhya text itself as the rule source, not paraphrase — which is exactly
    what §4 blocks on today.

---

## 10. Open questions for the project lead

- Confirm the archive.org scan (`pratisakhyarigv00sarmgoog`) as the digitization source, and
  approve the Gemini OCR cost estimate when one is produced (per CLAUDE.md).
- Confirm whether the Rigveda Śākala Pada-pāṭha should be sourced independently (e.g. from an
  existing digital edition) or derived from the Saṃhitā via a separate, also-validated,
  Pada-pāṭha generation project — that is out of scope for this document either way.
- Confirm an independently attested Krama-pāṭha source to use as the VALIDATE-mode ground
  truth for RV 1.1.1 and subsequent sūktas.

No code or data changes beyond this document are part of this commit; §4 and §10 are the
gating items before implementation can start.
