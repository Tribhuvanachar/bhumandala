/* =========================================================================
   Guru Vandana guard.

   The vandana lives at the site root, so it only ever greeted people who
   arrived at the front door. A bookmark or a shared deep link into any page
   under dge/ walked straight past it. This bounces such a visitor back to
   the gate, remembers where they were headed, and the gate delivers them
   there once respects have been paid — so closing the bypass costs nobody
   their link.

   Include it as the FIRST script in the <head> of every page under dge/. It
   is deliberately synchronous: it has to decide before the page paints, or
   the visitor sees a flash of the library they have not yet been admitted
   to.

   It fails OPEN, always. Every branch that cannot establish the facts lets
   the visitor through. A guard that traps people out of the library on a
   browser quirk would be far worse than one that occasionally lets someone
   past, and this is a courtesy, not a security control — there is nothing
   secret behind it.
