"""
DGE VedaWeb Rigveda Importer — v0.4 (switched primary text source to the
"eichler" witness after confirming against real diagnostic output that it
has proper sandhi, correct spelling, and standard Unicode accent marks —
"zurich" (the original choice) is word-tokenized for morphological
analysis and never applies sandhi at all, and several witnesses including
zurich share a genuine spelling inconsistency ("gachati" instead of
"gacchati") that's present in VedaWeb's own source data.)
================================================================================
Run this in Google Colab (or any local Python 3 with internet access).

v0.2 CHANGES FROM v0.1 — everything below was corrected against real
diagnostic output from an actual run, not guessed:
  - vedaweb_corpus.tei is just a metadata shell (empty <body>) that
    XIncludes 10 separate per-book files (rv_book_01.tei .. rv_book_10.tei,
    10-43MB each) — this version reads those 10 files directly instead.
  - rishi/devata are NOT per-stanza attributes/notes as first guessed —
    they live once per HYMN, inside a <div type="dedication"> block
    (addressee = devata, group = rishi), and apply to every stanza in
    that hymn.
  - The actual mantra text lives inside <lg source="zurich"> as a set of
    <l> lines (one per pada/quarter-verse) — each followed by a SIBLING
    <l id="..._tokens"> line holding word-by-word morphology, which must
    be skipped, not extracted as text.
  - The "zurich" witness text is in ROMANIZED ISO-15919 transliteration
    (e.g. "agním īḷe puróhitaṁ"), not Devanagari. Since DGE is
    Devanagari-first elsewhere (see stotra/pns/data.json), this version
    converts to Devanagari via the `indic_transliteration` library and
    keeps the original IAST alongside it for cross-checking.
  - Large files are processed ONE BOOK AT A TIME so memory use stays
    reasonable regardless of total corpus size.

Usage:
    pip install requests lxml indic_transliteration
    python vedaweb_import.py

    v0.3 correction — the v0.2 fix (reordering ring-below to sit directly
    after r/l, keeping any accent as a separate trailing mark) was tested
    on real output and did NOT work: "vŕ̥ṣaṇaṁ" / "dūredŕ̥śaṁ" still leaked
    raw Latin letters into the Devanagari output after that fix. So it
    wasn't about the ORDER of the two marks — the library apparently can't
    recognize vocalic r/l at all once a SECOND diacritic touches the same
    letter, regardless of arrangement.

    What's confirmed to work throughout this corpus: precomposed vowel +
    ONE trailing accent mark (e.g. "ī" + acute = "ī́", converts correctly
    everywhere). So instead of trying to make the library accept three
    stacked marks on a plain letter, this converts r/l + ring-below
    straight into the STANDARD precomposed IAST retroflex/vocalic
    character (ṛ / ḷ — same family as ā/ī/ū) BEFORE transliteration, with
    any accent left as a single trailing mark on that precomposed letter —
    matching the exact shape already proven to work, rather than a new
