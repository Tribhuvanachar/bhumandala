build_search_index.py — offline global-search index generator for DGE.

Fits the existing `veda_toolkit` pattern: a standalone Python script run locally
(or in Colab), NOT part of the live static app. It walks `dge/data/`, reads each
grantha's `data.json`, and emits a compact STATIC index the browser loads on
demand. No backend — this is what makes corpus-wide fuzzy search possible on a
GitHub Pages site.

It reuses DGE's own conventions:
  * `schemas.json :: <schema>.primaryTextField` tells us which field holds the
    main searchable text (null => text lives in a nested array, which we flatten).
  * handles BOTH data shapes: new `{schema, items:[...]}` and legacy
    `{metadata, shlokas:{n:{...}}}`.
  * prefers an unaccented `*_plain` field when present (e.g. samhita_patha_plain).
  * cross-references come from each item's `references:[{target,unit_id,note}]`;
    we invert them into a global backlinks index ("what cites this verse").

Sanskrit-aware matching: every unit's text is canonicalized to SLP1 and folded
into a phonetic key (pkey) and coarse key (ckey) by the shared normalizer
(search_toolkit_pkg/, the tested reference core). The SAME fold runs in the
browser at query time (js/dge-normalize.js), so index and query always agree.

Emitted artifacts (all under --out):
  manifest.json                catalog: granthas, categories, unit counts, the
                                section list (manifest.sections), and per-trigram
                                GLOBAL document frequency (manifest.df)
  units/<slug>.json            per-grantha units: {u, pk, ck, s(nippet)}
  postings/<trigram>/<section>.json
                                one file per (trigram, section) pair:
                                [ [granthaIdx, unitIdx], ... ], holding only
                                that trigram's postings within that section.
                                An unscoped query fans out across every
                                section's file for a trigram in parallel; a
                                scoped query reads only its own section.
                                (trigram directory name is percent-safe --
                                see safe_trigram_filename())
